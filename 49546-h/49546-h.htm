<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At</span> a time when Englishmen and
Frenchmen are brothers-in-arms, a
translation of this curious and little known
narrative may be of interest.</p>

<p>It is a record of a somewhat remarkable
episode in a stormy and remarkable
year. It describes, possibly not without
the inevitable bias of one sent on a forlorn
hope, the necessary refusals of Gladstone
and Lord Granville to intervene in favour
of France. But, as the writer quite prophetically
declares, the surrender of Alsace-Lorraine
and the aggrandisement of Prussia
were fated to be the inevitable stumbling-block
to peace in Europe, and so “not
without moment” to England. This we
now know only too well. 1870 was to
be the prelude of 1914.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Frederic Reitlinger was not by profession
a diplomatist, though circumstances
gave him this rôle for a brief and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
inglorious moment. He achieved some
distinction at the Bar in Paris under the
Second Empire, and at the request of
Napoleon III., made an exhaustive study
of the co-operative movements in England,
France and Germany. When the Empire
fell, after Sedan, he accepted the position
of private secretary to the head of the
provisional government, M. Jules Favre.
It may well have been his striking and
remarkable gift of eloquence&mdash;attested to
by all who heard him plead in the courts&mdash;that
prompted Favre and the Government
in beleaguered Paris to choose him
for the desperate task of attempting to win
over the rulers of England and Austria.
The effort failed, as it was bound to fail,
but not discreditably.</p>

<p>After the Peace of Frankfort, Frederic
Reitlinger devoted himself to his practice
at the Cour d’Appel. He died in 1907.</p>

<span class="smaller"><span class="smcap">The Political Situation</span></span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It</span> was the last week in the month of
October, 1870. M. Jules Favre, at
that time Vice-President and Minister for
Foreign Affairs in the National Defence
Government, summoned me to his office
in the Quai d’Orsay and said:</p>

<p>“You will find it very strange, but since
yesterday I have changed my mind. I now
wish to entrust you with another mission.
I want you to go to Vienna and London.
The last news which has reached us makes
me hope for a change of public opinion in
Europe. There is beginning to be anxiety
for our fate; public sympathy seems to be
turning in our favour and coming back
to us. Europe admires the resistance we
are making and is perhaps not far from
wishing us successful.”</p>

<p>In his grave and wonderfully modulated
voice he described the situation as it appeared
to him. Paris was splendid in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
courage and enthusiasm; the whole of
France was up and decided for resistance;
South Germany was discontented with the
iron hand weighing upon her, and anxious
to finish a war into which she had been
dragged against her will, and which was
devouring her strength and ruining her
country. Finally, Europe returned from
her apathy, was deeply impressed by
France’s efforts, and looked forward to
the end of what threatened to degenerate
into a war of destruction which would
seriously shatter the equilibrium and
general interests of Europe.</p>

<p>I am well aware that this picture was
not true at all points; I know that there
was much illusion in the hope which
animated the Minister’s patriotic heart, of
seeing Europe cast aside her inertia and
raise her voice on behalf of conquered
France against the conqueror ... in
favour of a great and generous people
which had fought so much for others,
and which was now defending its own
hearths and the integrity of its national
soil against a formidable invasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
To-day we know all the springs of
that steel ring which encircled France
and checkmated the whole of Europe by
robbing her of all initiative and liberty of
movement. To-day it is certainly easy to
laugh at these generous hopes, but at that
moment they were shared by all. And it
would have been difficult in the great,
brave town of Paris, where so much devotion,
energy and patriotism had united
for a supreme struggle for existence, to find
spirits sober enough to consider the enterprise
a vain one, or sufficiently far-sighted
or discouraged to regard such generous
promptings as illusions.</p>

<p>You who have lived through the siege
of Paris, try and recollect the tremendous
change which the situation had undergone
since the 4th of September, and admit I
am not exaggerating.</p>

<p>After the disaster of Sedan, when the
enemy’s columns were marching without
obstacle against a Paris shorn of troops,
materials and munitions of war,&mdash;lacking
everything that might allow of further
resistance&mdash;everyone thought that the war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
was finished, that the defeat of France
was consummated, and that resistance, even
for a day, would be absolutely impossible.</p>

<p>We were told at that time to “hold out”
a little longer, to resist for only a few
weeks, in order to allow public opinion
in Europe to awaken. If Paris could
defend herself, if she could only maintain
herself a few weeks, we were told, the
impression in Europe would be immense,
and sympathy for us would revive. The
provinces would have time to form an
army and to come to our rescue, and
Europe would be able to raise her voice
in favour of an honourable peace.</p>

<p>Such was the language which official
visitors to the Quai d’Orsay daily uttered
to our Minister for Foreign Affairs; and
even if the spirited population of Paris
had not peremptorily demanded resistance,
communications from the Diplomatic Body,
(I am not speaking of their advice, for
<i>that</i> they could not give), would have imposed
on the National Defence Government
the imperious duty of attempting a final
effort. And the effort <i>was</i> attempted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
admirably maintained by the heroic town.
We were asked to “hold on,” and we did
“hold on.”</p>

<p>The great city held out, and not only
for some weeks. Nearly two months had
passed since the catastrophe of Sedan, two
months employed in organising resistance.</p>

<p>At the moment of which I am speaking,
Paris had already undergone more
than fifty days of siege without weakening.
Do I say without weakening? On the
contrary, the greater her privations, the
greater became her courage; the greater
the wastage of her resources, the greater
the strength of her resistance. A whole
arsenal had been improvised, a redoubtable
fortress had been created out of
nothing. The ramparts, which at the
approach of the Prussians were bare of
everything, had been swiftly furnished
with cannon, ammunition, and defenders;
the peaceable citizens had changed into
soldiers, the workshops had become factories
for arms&mdash;in a word, this charming
and beautiful town, the city of wit and
pleasure, was transformed into a vast armed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
camp forming the centre of radiating
sectors which united her closely with the
ramparts.</p>

<p>The spirit of war had breathed into
men’s souls, and manly enthusiasm
reigned supreme; unshakable confidence
inflamed the most timid minds and filled
them with courage. And with courage
hope had entered into all hearts, and faith
had revived&mdash;the faith of soldiers, the
conviction of success. All men sincerely
believed in it.</p>

<p>How could one admit that all these
great endeavours, these generous aspirations,
all this sublime devotion should
remain sterile, that the intelligence and
energy, in a word all the great and wonderful
spirit of a nation fighting for its
life, should result in deception and vanity!</p>

<p>And would Europe, who was watching
us and observing our efforts, remain dumb?
Would she shut herself up in selfish indifference,
cross her arms and assist as a
careless spectator in the mutilation of
France, in the humiliation of a great people
which had fought so much for others and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
which was now struggling for existence?
Would Europe allow the dismemberment
of a great-spirited country, so necessary to
the equilibrium and the very existence of
Europe? Such a thing was not to be
thought of.</p>

<p>So it came about that, when we heard
of considerable changes in the public
opinion of Europe, and when it was
reported that the Powers, astonished at
our prodigious efforts, were not disinclined
from joining their activities to ours
in order to arrive at the conclusion of an
honourable peace, we thought the news
very plausible, and it found ready credence.</p>

<p>And when M. Jules Favre, changing the
purpose of the mission that he wanted to
entrust to me before, and which it is unnecessary
I should speak of here, asked
me to undertake a journey to the Courts
of Vienna and London in order to try and
interest these Powers more directly in the
struggle and to lead them into effective
intervention on our behalf, it was well
worth the attempt, and I was proud to be
its bearer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Let me explain further.</p>

<p>When the unfortunate declaration of
war was hurled into the midst of a
peaceable Europe sleeping in profound
security, it provoked universal stupefaction
and disgust. Every state had reduced
its contingents, every parliament
had terminated its labours, after casting
a smiling and satisfied glance at the complete
tranquillity of the universe. Every
sovereign was making holiday, or reposing
with gently closed eyes in the most retired
part of his princely residence. Every
people was intent on its affairs and preparing,
in absolute security, for the peaceful
labours of the harvest. The entire
universe was tasting the sweets of a
general peace and resting in a quietude
threatened by no discord.</p>

<p>The explosion of the “année terrible”
crashed through all these countries, awoke
every parliament, stupified every sovereign,
and irritated every people. The world was
disgusted by the nation which had fired
off the sacrilegious cannon and let loose
the scourge of war into the midst of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
situation which was regarded as the Golden
Age of universal peace. It was France
that had troubled this beneficent peace. It
was France that, without appreciable cause,
had provoked the frightful struggle. So
much the worse for her if she succumbed
to what she had herself unchained without
a thought for the general interests of
Europe.</p>

<p>Such was the opinion, the “state of
soul,” as they say nowadays, of Europe at
the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>France was completely isolated, in the
most distressing sense of the word; that
is to say, she not only had not a single
ally, but not a single sympathiser. All
her neighbours, States, sovereigns, and
people, even her oldest friends, had turned
from her as from a criminal who had
destroyed public happiness.</p>

<p>But when, after disasters without name
and precedent in the glorious history of
France, the brave population sprang up
again under defeat like a steel blade, when
after the war of regular armies there commenced
a new war of a people which would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
not surrender, but insisted on remaining
erect and fighting with the broken sword
picked up on the battlefield of its conquered
armies, which insisted on battling for the
honour of life and the integrity of its
sacred soil, then her most obstinate enemies
admired and saluted a resistance unexampled
in history, and contemplated with
ever-growing interest the struggle of a
scarcely-armed people against the best
trained, best led, and most formidable
armies which had ever invaded an enemy’s
country. France, which had yesterday
been found guilty of commencing the war,
became in defeat the object of admiration
and a living image of the civic virtues;
Europe recovered from her irritation and
began with an anxious eye to follow and
to desire the end of an unequal duel.</p>

<p>We therefore had reason to hope that we
might find in the great Powers, not only the
sympathy with which everyone had been
inspired by our resistance, but the firm
desire to help us in our efforts at arriving
at the conclusion of an honourable peace.</p>

<p>Certainly I could not, and did not, hope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
to succeed in drawing either England or
Austria into a war against Prussia. I knew
both countries too well to abandon myself
to such an illusion. But what we hoped
for with conviction, and what we had
reason to hope for, was that the European
Powers, in the general interests of the
future, would arrive at an entente, and
would associate themselves in an effort to
obtain from Prussia terms of peace less
harsh than those which the latter had
proudly been announcing ever since the
first days of her victories.</p>

<p>If Austria and England seriously desired
this result, then Italy, that beautiful kingdom
for whose unity France had poured
out the best of her blood, could not withdraw
from the union, and Russia, herself
a powerful and precious friend of the old
King of Prussia, would be happy to serve
as mediator between the Powers thus
united and Germany.</p>

<p>There was, in fact, reason to hope that
the Powers would come to an understanding
with the object of speaking the
language of reason to Prussia and making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
her understand, with firmness and resolution,
that all Europe was interested in
seeing this war terminated by a lasting
peace, whose conditions could be accepted
without humiliation and without the
arrière pensée that a contract, accepted by
France against her will and under the force
of necessity, might be torn up in time to
come. Such were my sincere hopes.</p>

<p>What really happened disappointed these
hopes. But that does not prove that we
were wrong in conceiving and attempting
the enterprise, and there will certainly
come a day<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a>&mdash;perhaps not far distant&mdash;when
history will judge that European
diplomacy then lost one of the most propitious
occasions for laying the foundations
of a pacifist policy and preparing
the era of general disarmament. Already
to-day this dream might be realised, to
the profit and happiness of all humanity.
For if France had not been mutilated,
what obstacle would there now be to the
general disarmament of Europe?</p>

<p>We had also received divers reports
concerning Prussia’s allies.</p>

<p>Certain individuals, who claimed and
believed themselves to be well informed,
carried rumours which were really very
extraordinary to the Hôtel de Ville.
Bavaria and Wurtemburg, it was said,
were tired of the war, tired in particular
of always seeing their soldiers in the front
rank, and ardently desirous of peace. One
even went so far as to say that South
Germany was animated by great discontent
against Prussia, and that a breach was not
far distant.</p>

<p>It really needed absolute ignorance of
the true situation in Germany to believe
even for an instant such chimeras as
these. It was certainly true that in the
month of July, 1870, neither Bavaria nor
Wurtemburg were enthusiastic for a war
which the parliaments of these two countries
had only voted with difficulty. It is
equally true that at the beginning of the
campaign, a single small advantage won
over the Prussians, even a swift march of
the French army beyond the Rhine, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
have been sufficient to expose Prussia to
the risk of being isolated and left alone in
her struggle with France. But the situation
had been completely changed since the prodigious
and terrible successes of the armies
of M. de Moltke.</p>

<p>At the beginning France was feared, and
there was no desire to embark on a war
whose issue was in doubt. So great was
the anxiety, that the Rhine provinces made
hasty preparations for receiving the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pantalons
rouges</i>.” It was already believed
that France was on the threshold, and it
was feared that she would cross it from
one day to the other. But when it was
seen that the French did not arrive, when
the Prussians crossed the Rhine and won
victory after victory, then immense enthusiasm,
an unparalleled delirium, seized
the whole of Germany, and the people
would have dethroned their kings and
driven out their ministers had there been
a single one willing to separate himself
from the common cause of the German
Fatherland’s sacred war against the hereditary
enemy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
It was indeed all Germany that was
against us. And it required absolute
ignorance of her inclinations, of her tendencies,
and of her aspirations, to seriously
believe that discord could still exist in
Germany after the unhoped-for successes
of her armies.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was arranged that I was to leave at
once.</p>

<p>In order to receive M. Jules Favre’s last
instructions, the day before my departure
I went back to see him at the Hôtel de
Ville, where the National Defence Government
sat every evening until a very late
hour of the night. That evening the
Council sat till one in the morning. At
nine o’clock on the 28th of October my
balloon was to leave the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gare d’Orléans</i>.</p>

<p>In the next chapter the reader will find
a description of my journey; it was adventurous
enough in all conscience, but I
have not allowed the story of it to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
before the necessary resumé of the political
situation and of the sentiments of Europe
towards ourselves.</p>

<p>I cannot, however, resist a desire to
describe a scene which I witnessed en
route, and which moved me to tears.
The reader will excuse me if I tell it
here. He will not read it without
emotion.</p>

<p>Early one morning, in the beautiful
Norman countryside between Eu and
Dieppe, if I am not mistaken, we met a
hundred or so young recruits on the road,
freshly enrolled for the terrible war. They
were very lightly clad, as if for a summer
excursion to the country.</p>

<p>The biting morning wind whistled cruelly
through their cotton trousers, and I felt
my teeth chatter with cold, but these brave
Norman boys did not feel the cold. They
marched on gaily, singing the Marseillaise,
and when they passed our carriage they
waved their felt hats in token of gaiety,
as if they were going to a fête, and, carried
away by enthusiasm, they cried, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Vive la
République! Vive la France!</i>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
A tear fell from my eye&mdash;one of those
bitter tears that run silently along one’s
cheek, like the overflow of a great grief.
I wiped my eyes and whispered, “<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">E pur
si muove.</i>”</p>

<p>Such gaiety in the face of danger, such
conviction, such sublime faith in the midst
of so many ruins! Is not this the fundamental
strength of the French character
and its great superiority, in spite of
the proverbial fickleness with which it
has been reproached since the time of
Cæsar? Is not this the secret of the
immense resilience and strength of our
country?</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="it" lang="it">E pur si muove!</i>” Yes, the cause of
such a people could not be lost. It must
force fortune to smile and victory to return
to its banners.</p>

<p>Everywhere I met the same enthusiasm
and the same confidence in our final
success, and certainly, had it been within
the bounds of human possibility to repair
the disasters of the terrible campaign,
France would have accomplished the
miracle and would not have succumbed.</p>

<p class="in0">But against physical impossibilities no
struggle can succeed; all strength exhausts
itself, the strong will weakens, and patriotism,
courage and resistance to the last,
every prodigy of flaming love for one’s
country, is impotent to effect the impossible&mdash;impotent
to do what is beyond human
strength.</p>

<p>Many have criticised the desperate efforts
of a people who refuse to recognise that
they are beaten, and do not acknowledge
the evidence of defeat; but these are precisely
the efforts which, in spite of final
defeat, will be written in its history in
letters of gold.</p>

<p>All the victories and glories, all the past
grandeurs of the nation, pale in the presence
of the greatness, unique in history,
of a vanquished people which would not
despair and would not surrender, a people
which, when its Government, its army, its
generals, all had foundered around it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
alone remained upright to save its honour,
grasping in one hand its flag and in the
other the hilt of its broken sword.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I was convinced, in the course of my
journey across Europe, and particularly by
my welcome in Austria and England, that
France, who was detested at the beginning
of the war for having suddenly lit such a
formidable fire, had reconquered general
esteem by the energy she showed in the
midst of her disasters.</p>

<p>M. de Chaudordy, whom I saw at Tours,
gave me much encouragement in the interviews
I had with him before leaving for
Vienna. This gentleman was in daily communication
with the representatives of the
Powers at Tours and so was better able
than we, who had been shut up in Paris,
to give an exact estimate of the opinion of
Europe and the changes it had undergone.
He assured me that M. Jules Favre was
right in telling me that there was a considerable
move in our favour in the sympathies
of Europe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
He also, without abandoning himself to
over-sanguine ideas, hoped much from this
change of opinion. He thought that the
efforts which I was about to make in the
Cabinets of Vienna and London ought to
be attempted, and that they might very well
produce satisfactory results.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances I was all
impatience to leave and arrive at Vienna,
since, according to my instructions, the
Austrian Government was the first that I
was to address. But before going to
Vienna I wanted to inform myself as to
the situation in Germany, in order to be
able to speak with full <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">connaissance de
cause</i>.</p>

<p>I left Tours in the first days of
November, and directed my course towards
Germany.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE DEPARTURE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Our</span> departure from Paris was fixed
for the 28th of October, at nine
in the morning.</p>

<p>It was a beautifully fresh and clear day.
The sky was cloudless and the sun sent its
fairest rays over the earth, while an icy
wind swept the calm and deserted streets
of the capital. In spite of the early hour
there were already many people standing
round the balloon, which was being inflated.
Two or three hundred of the
curious had come to watch our departure.</p>

<p>When I arrived the balloon was filling
slowly and pompously. It was already
beginning to leave the ground, little by
little and majestically, like a giant rising
out of the earth.</p>

<p>Its formidable mass was soon entirely
upright, and balanced and shifted as if
impatient to take flight.</p>

<p>Now it has mounted and floats in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
wind over its little “nacelle” or car, the
latter still firmly attached to the ground
to allow its cargo to be loaded.</p>

<p>The car was packed with five or six
mail-bags full of correspondence and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">depêches</i>&mdash;thousands of little letters, on
the fine paper invented during the Siege
of Paris for the needs of a new correspondence
service through the clouds&mdash;rare
and impatiently expected messages
which distributed to France outside the
solace of a written line and a living
signal from the beloved ones shut up
within the ramparts.</p>

<p>When all was loaded, it was the
passengers’ turn. Before going up it
was necessary to know the direction of
the wind. As all the east of France was
already invested, balloons could only leave
with some chance of safety if the wind
blew towards the west.</p>

<p>This was the only precaution taken
in despatching balloons, which were left
literally to the mercy of the winds. Our
party had not even a compass to indicate
the direction we were taking, as if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
winds always remained the same and never
changed, and as if it were sufficient to know
its direction at departure in order also to
know where we should arrive.</p>

<p>Our departure was accordingly preceded
by a “ballon d’essai,” which was let up
in order to explore the air and show the
direction of the wind. The direction was
a good one, and the wind propitious&mdash;<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">obstrictis
aliis, praeter Iapiga</i>.&mdash;The wind
showed itself from the east, and the little
pioneer balloon went off gaily, promptly to
disappear over the western horizon. Then
came a solemn voice: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Messieurs les voyageurs
en ballon!</i>” I shall never forget
that voice; I can hear it in my ears to-day.</p>

<p><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Messieurs les voyageurs, en ballon!</i> A
quick, last goodbye to one’s friends, then
up the little rope ladder which leads to the
basket and a last look back. A last handshake,
and here we are, seated in our aerial
craft, bound for an unknown destination.</p>

<p>The unknown always contains an element
of the fearsome, and without being
exactly anxious as regards the physical
dangers of our journey, we had a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
feeling of solemnity when the basket left
the earth. There were three passengers&mdash;M.
Cassier, the Director of the French
pigeon-post&mdash;who had brought a number
of his faithful messengers with him; a
sailor, who acted as an improvised aeronaut;
and myself.</p>

<p>We all made ourselves as comfortable
as possible on the little wicker seats which
were fitted inside the basket. There were
two of these, facing each other, and on
each there was room for two persons.
Piled up at our feet at the bottom of the
basket were the sacks of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">depêches</i> and
letters, and the ballast. The anchor was
firmly fastened to the side of the basket,
fastened even too firmly, and altogether too
heavy to be of use in case of accidents.</p>

<p>The whole thing might have weighed about
a ton. As soon as we were seated, the
balloon began to tack about. Our departure
was not effected without difficulty.
The balloon had to be guided so as to
leave it a free passage, in order that in its
ascent it should not encounter and demolish
the roofs of the houses surrounding the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
open space of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gare d’Orleans</i>. This
was not an easy operation; it required time
and a certain amount of skill on the part
of those who were holding on to the
balloon and watching its ascent, and who
were only supposed to let it entirely free
when the basket had passed the tops of
the houses. These complicated manœuvres
were long and gave us time to look around
us and think....</p>

<p>Suddenly we heard the sacramental
words, “Let go.” The moment had
arrived.</p>

<p>All hands simultaneously let go of the
ropes and quickly cut the moorings. The
balloon was free, and mounted swiftly,
turning round its axis, great and majestic
as an eagle in flight. “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon voyage</i>,
bold travellers, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bon voyage</i>!” shouted the
crowd, and everybody waved their hands,
handkerchiefs, and hats. There were even
flags floating gaily in the breeze. It was a
touching thing to see all these arms held
out to us, and sending us a last goodbye
from the beloved earth which we were
leaving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
It was a very short moment and passed
like a flash. The balloon turned on itself
with dizzy swiftness. It went up, and up,
and up, always turning.</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Gare d’Orleans</i>, the streets of Paris
with their houses, the monuments, the last
lines of the city, the circle of fortifications,
the countryside with its fortresses, all appeared
and disappeared with maddening
rapidity. The eye no longer saw and the
intelligence ceased in stupefaction, paralysed
by this mad, gigantic dance, without
purpose and without end.</p>

<p>Where were we and where were we
going? What was the meaning of this
continual turning? When would we stop
and what would be the end of this phenomenal
journey?</p>

<p>The sun was radiant and the shadows
were deep and clearly defined. The wind
whipped and hastened the spinning of our
balloon. Contrasts followed each other
with such prodigious swiftness that it
became impossible to follow them. Sight
and mind slid over this marvellous ocean
as if in a dream, no longer distinguishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
shape or time or space. Where were we?
We did not know; one half-minute of the
balloon’s free course was enough to make
us feel completely lost. If the balloon had
only proceeded in a straight line in the
same way as any other known craft, we
should not have lost the bearing of our starting-point,
in spite of the swiftness of our
progress; but the balloon twisted ceaselessly
and with terrible rapidity about its own
axis. After a few revolutions that were
quicker than lightning, it was impossible
to recognise the direction in which we
were going or to know our position.</p>

<p>Whither were we going? Left, right,
south or north&mdash;it was impossible to say.</p>

<p>A compass might have told us. But,
as I have already said, our balloon had
no compass, a thing so necessary to every
navigator. Our only instrument was a
little barometric scale which registered the
height at which the balloon was travelling.
In addition the unfortunate sailor, who
was our improvised aeronaut and who was
to direct our expedition, had as much
knowledge of the art of aerial navigation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
as an inhabitant of the moon has of the
mysteries of the Indian Brahmans. This
will give you an exact idea of the manner
in which our journey was undertaken.
Our expedition went off, in a doubly true
sense, at the mercy of chance and the wind.</p>

<span class="subhead">WONDERS AND EVENTS OF AN AERIAL VOYAGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> were, however, all three very glad
and proud of our journey. We
were in excellent spirits, and our hearts beat
more rapidly at the thought of doing something
for the wonderful defence of the great
besieged city and of taking our share in
the common effort.</p>

<p>We did not even think of danger, and
not one of us would have stopped to consider
for a moment the defective equipment
and slightly precarious nature of our
conveyance. We were entirely given up
to our enterprise and to the magnificent
spectacle which rolled, renewing itself
every moment, before our astonished eyes.
It mattered little to us where we were or
where we were going; we were at least
sure of not stopping on the way.</p>

<p>Suddenly our attention was awakened
by a singular and characteristic sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
which struck our ears and informed us,
in no uncertain manner, of our whereabouts.
We were crossing the lines of
the besieging army, and the latter were
presenting their compliments by shooting
at us with rifles. But their bullets were
unable to hit us. Though we heard them
whistling, that did not prevent the balloon
from continuing its swift course towards
unassailable altitudes.</p>

<p>We soon rose out of the range of their
marksmen, and the rifle fire ceased as
suddenly as it had begun. Our attention
was then again drawn to the wonders and
surprises of our aerial voyage.</p>

<p>This is a thing I cannot describe, and
even to-day, after the lapse of twenty-eight
years, I cannot find words to give any
idea of the prodigious spectacle ceaselessly
rolling at our feet, or of the deep and
ineffacable impression which it produced
on us. Only those who have made the
ascent of high mountains can realise feebly
what is a journey in the air at a height of
two or three thousands yards.</p>

<p>Who is there who has not once in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
life enjoyed that experience, who does not
know the imposing calm and the absolute
silence that reign over the eternal glaciers,
the effect of which, in conjunction with the
immense panorama which these almost inaccessible
heights unfold, is to fill the spirit
of the traveller with sublime admiration
and a species of poetic delirium? Well,
the impression left on me by this aerial
journey far outstrips the fairy memories
of mountain glaciers.</p>

<p>There was the same calm, the same
absolute and grandiose silence, the same
majestic response, as if at the approach of
the Divinity, but the horizon was wider and
the view more varied. The balloon floated
on, and the horizon changed every minute
with the rapidity of its course. The subdued
tints of the far distance served as a sort of
border to the fresher and more accentuated
colours of those tracts of country that were
nearer and bathed in light. Valleys and
mountains followed each other and mingled
like the ever-renewed waves of the sea.</p>

<p>The waves of the sea are an exact comparison,
for there was always an immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
ocean under our eyes, an ocean such as no
mariner has ever beheld. It comprised
and blended together all things&mdash;plain
and mountain, earth and river, cities and
countryside, meadows and forests. Every
possible contrast was linked together, every
colour and every tone stood out and was
reflected, and on this great, glistening ocean
under a cloudless sky the gigantic shadow
of the balloon travelled like the image of
some unknown spectre, striding across the
universe.</p>

<p>I can find no further words, and think
that no human speech is able to describe
the fascination of the amazing scene that
sprang as it were from an unknown world
before our dazzled eyes.</p>

<p>As the balloon continued its course,
sometimes slowly, as if cradled by the
zephyrs, and sometimes violently agitated
by the breath of the storm which was
already threatening, we became accustomed
to the grandeur of the ceaselessly changing
spectacle.</p>

<p>Once recovered from our amazement, it
seemed to us natural to be thus transported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
in an aerial vessel two thousand
yards above our ordinary habitations, and
we tried to make ourselves as comfortable
as we could in the car. The air was fresh,
and although the sun was veiled by no trace
of clouds, the temperature at these altitudes
was very chilly. Our first need, therefore,
was to protect ourselves against the cold
and to cover ourselves from the icy atmosphere
with everything we could find. Our
second preoccupation was hunger.</p>

<p>We had left Paris before nine in the
morning. The fresh air had set our blood
in motion and awakened our appetites. At
half-past ten the crew of the “Vauban”&mdash;that
was the name of the balloon&mdash;simultaneously
remarked, “Luncheon.”</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. We had not
far to go to find the restaurant, nor did
our meal require great preparations.</p>

<p>We each drew out of our pockets the
provisions we had brought, and these provisions
were by no means extravagant. At
this period Paris was already under rations
as far as meat was concerned, and if my
memory serves me aright, I think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
everyone in Paris had at that time the
right to four ounces of beef, whose only
connection with that succulent comestible
was its name, given it under false pretences
and in order to deceive the palates
of the Parisians.</p>

<p>But if our repast was modest and meagre,
the wine which washed it down was excellent
and our appetites were first-rate....
Moreover, the view from the balcony of
our dining-room was enough to make us
forget the frugality of our repast and transform
the simplest menu into a feast. When
we had finished eating and drinking we
sent a telegram to M. Jules Favre.</p>

<p>A telegram from a balloon? Yes, a real
telegram.</p>

<p>You have not forgotten that M. Cassier,
Director of the French Pigeon Post, was
with me, and that he had brought a score
of pigeons with him. One of these graceful
birds was charged with a message for M.
Jules Favre. I had promised to inform
him as well as I could of the events of
our journey. The most hazardous part
seemed to me to be already accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
This was far from being the case, as
will be seen later, but that is what I
thought at the moment. We had been
crossing the enemy’s lines for a considerable
time and our balloon had not ceased
moving with very great and noticeable
rapidity and without changing its direction.
We therefore had reason to suppose that
we were not far from those western latitudes
where we were to descend. This
was the sense of my message. I added a
few notes on the regions we had traversed
and the different altitudes to which we had
attained&mdash;for it is interesting to remark that
our balloon, without apparent reason, often
rose to a height of two thousand yards or
more, and afterwards, again without reason,
fell to one hundred and fifty yards and less.</p>

<p>When I had finished my note, I rolled
up tightly the square of paper on which it
had been written and tied it up. M. Cassier
concealed the little roll under the pigeon’s
wings by skilfully attaching it to the upper
part of one of the bird’s legs. And then
“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Bon voyage</i> for Paris!”</p>

<p>It was curious to see the departure of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
our messenger. The little bird seemed to
share our own uncertainty as to the direction
we were taking and did not appear to
know its bearings. But its embarrassment
did not last as long as ours: once it had
left the balloon it flew two or three times
round it, always coming back on its traces
as if to find out where it was and seeking
its route, and sheltering itself near us as
long as it felt uncertain. But suddenly it
lifted its delicate little head, gave a cry of
joy, and flew off like an arrow in a
straight line, without deviating or looking
to the left or right. It had found its way
and was going straight back to its nest in
Paris.</p>

<span class="subhead">A CHANGE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This</span> was the end of the peaceful part
of our voyage and the prelude of a
new and more exciting phase.</p>

<p>The wind, whistling ceaselessly, finished
by somewhere picking up a few clouds
which had been almost imperceptible in
the four corners of the horizon. The
balloon’s course began to be less regular;
sometimes it jumped in a disquieting
manner, and our barometer then showed
variations of one thousand yards in a
few minutes. Once we were even so near
the earth that we were able to speak to
peasants who were working in the fields.
We asked them to tell us where we were,
and they seemed to have understood our
question, for they answered us, but we
could not catch their reply.</p>

<p>The excessive swiftness with which the
balloon had passed prevented us from
understanding what they said. The sound
of their voices only reached us as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
distant echo of human speech. Our
ears only heard inarticulate sounds whose
meaning escaped us, so swiftly was the
distance increased which separated our
question from their answer.</p>

<p>At another time the car floated majestically
over an immense plain which filled
the horizon and stretched as far as the
eye could see. Then it was I wanted to
effect our descent. I said so to our aeronaut,
and asked him to open the valve and let
the gas escape slowly, so as to allow our
balloon to sink gently to the ground.</p>

<p>The plain which was unfolded before
our eyes seemed to me created expressly
for a successful landing. Here we could
descend without fearing any of those
terrible accidents which threatened every
descent on less propitious ground. For
a balloon does not always stop when it
reaches the earth; it often drags its car and
knocks it with terrible rage against obstacles,
as we ourselves were destined to see.</p>

<p>Nothing of the kind was to be feared
here. The balloon might graze the earth
and drag the car along the ground as much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
as it liked without any great danger to
ourselves. It was bound to end at any
moment by literally expiring, without
crushing its passengers in its agony. But
it was fated that we were to continue our
journey and descend later on in a less
peaceable manner.</p>

<p>The sailor certainly made an excellent
soldier, as did all the brave seamen who
had pluckily done their duty in the Siege
of Paris; but as an aeronaut he was
mediocre. He took no account of anything,
neither the direction we had
followed, nor the swift speed of our
passage, nor the distance we must have
traversed since our start from Paris. He
said: “If you give orders to come down,
I will open the valve. I will do so to obey
orders, but may I take the liberty of saying
that we have not yet gone very far. We
shall fall into the enemy’s lines, and once
the valve is open we shall not be able to
go up again.” I was not of this opinion;
I considered that we must be very far from
Paris and that this plain must be one of
the fertile plains of Normandy, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
extend from the banks of the Seine to the
sea. We had been travelling for more than
two hours with a powerful east wind and
had moved with almost painful speed the
whole time. Unless one supposed that
the balloon had changed its direction on
the way, which was by no means probable
as the wind had not changed at all, it was
easy to estimate the distance which we must
have traversed.</p>

<p>It was sufficient to watch the shadow of
the balloon gliding at express speed over
the distant earth.</p>

<p>If the course of this immense phantom
appeared very rapid to us at a height of
one thousand or one thousand five hundred
yards, what must have been the real speed
of the balloon itself, which projected such
a rapid shadow into the distance!</p>

<p>I imparted this reflection to our pilot,
but he was insensible to my arguments and
would not listen. He shook his head in
doubt, and without consenting to discuss
my reasons, repeated: “If you give the
order, I will obey; but I think it will be
better to wait.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
I finally gave way and consented to wait.
After all, I said to myself, we were not
badly off in the air, and it was always
better to be a little longer up there than
to come down too quickly and fall into the
hands of the enemy.</p>

<p>So we continued our journey.</p>

<p>It was a mistake, an irreparable mistake,
one which came near costing us dear.</p>

<p>From that moment the weather suddenly
changed, and a quarter of an hour later
all hope of ending our journey peaceably
by a regular descent was completely lost.</p>

<p>The horizon, which up till now had been
clear and radiant, began to take on a disquietingly
sombre tint. Mists arose. We
could not see where they came from, but
they came, interminably rolling and surging
and thickening more and more; a
tempest was forming around us. It was
a strange scene, at once beautiful and
terrible, and its very horror so contributed
to its beauty that I forgot for the moment
that we were ourselves about to play a part
in the drama.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE STORM</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I</span> will try and set down what I saw.
The balloon was above the tempest
that was forming; the storm was in preparation,
so to speak, under our eyes. The
sky above our heads did not change in
aspect, but remained placid and transparently
blue.</p>

<p>We were therefore floating over the
clouds, with a full view of the storm
beneath us and the unclouded sun above
us.</p>

<p>It was a dazzling contrast; over our
heads was the golden and intense brilliance
of an unclouded blue sky, the transparent
azure of pure air inundated with
light, and under our feet lay deep and
changeable night&mdash;a black, weltering mass
of uneasy chaos, that seemed as if set in
motion by the hands of giants; a nameless
thing without a form or colour that rolled
and eddied and swarmed&mdash;the <i>Tohu-bohu</i>
of Genesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
It might have been an army of Titans
whipping and tormenting the clouds, that
were piled up and shattered on one
another, and again piled up and shattered
endlessly.</p>

<p>And over this feverish chaos we heard
the rumble of thunder, while the violent
and icy wind drove the clouds as a wolf
does the sheep when it falls upon a flock.
Our poor balloon, though it was great and
heavy, carrying, as I have said, not less
than a ton, was as light as a feather on the
wings of the hurricane. It danced madly
up and down, shaken and tossed about like
a fragile skiff. So we rolled over this
stormy sea without compass or rudder,
fascinated by the grandeur and the strangeness
of the sight.</p>

<p>How long were we in the storm?</p>

<p>I cannot say; but suddenly the aeronaut
cried, “Monsieur, we are sinking!” And
the balloon, without showing any breakage
to explain such an accident, sank rapidly, or
rather dropped perpendicularly, like a mass.</p>

<p>We were then still above the clouds,
which were shedding torrents of rain on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
to the earth, and it was impossible for us
to see through the thick night which lay
cold and damp under our feet. We tried
in vain to find our bearings and to guess
how or where the balloon would strand us.
Would we be cast on terra firma or into
the sea; on mountains or on to the trees
of a forest?</p>

<p>It was a critical moment.</p>

<p>Lighten the balloon, quickly! And in
a moment we were all occupied in lifting
our ballast&mdash;big sacks of sand&mdash;out of the
hold, and the inhabitants of the country
over which we were passing must have
been astonished at seeing a sudden rain
of gravel mixed with the showers of water
which were drowning the countryside.</p>

<p>But we could not deal quickly enough
with the ballast, and the balloon continued
to sink. It descended with a rapidity that
made us shudder and drove us to work
with feverish activity. We heaved over the
sacks of ballast as briskly as real sailors
who have done nothing else all their lives.
Each of us laboured at our task, and the
sand fell like hail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
Suddenly the daylight disappeared and
darkness enveloped us. We were inundated
by a cold, intense fog and pierced
to the skin by icy dampness. We were
running through a veritable aerial tunnel,
to use a permissible metaphor. The clouds
which the storm had just before been rolling
at our feet were now all round our
balloon and us. When the balloon had
passed through them, dripping with rain
and frost, I saw with amazement that we
were just above an immense wood which
pointed its spikes at us like so many
threatening spears. We were inevitably
about to land in the middle of this wood
and in the branches of its trees.</p>

<p>I remained standing in order to see
better, but what I saw was terrifying. A
thick and endless forest extended under
our eyes, showing thousands of branches
like so many terrible defences ready to tear
us. Nowhere was there a clearing which
might give us hope.</p>

<p>The balloon continued falling, in spite
of its being lightened, with all the speed
of its enormous weight. I could not help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
looking, like a man who cannot help himself
and who sees himself being hurled into
an inevitable abyss.</p>

<p>“If we could only pass the wood!” I
had scarcely uttered these words when a
terrible noise was heard. We were shaken
by a frightful shock, which seemed as if
it would dislocate all our limbs. The car
was thrown among the trees and bounded
against them, breaking them into small
fragments. It was a terrible fall, but when
it came to the point and I felt the first signs
of the end I gave a sigh of relief. “This is
it, at last&mdash;this is the end!” The unknown,
which one fears and trembles at and cannot
avoid, is always more terrible than the
reality, once one has seen the latter face
to face.</p>

<p>But all, unfortunately, was not yet over,
and still greater and more violent turns of
fortune were to await us. The car alone
had crashed against the trees, breaking
them with the violence of the shock, but
the balloon still floated intact over the
basket, presenting its whole volume to the
wind. It dragged us with terrific force<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
over the trees, which broke under the
shock and at the same time held back
the car entangled in the broken and
twisted branches.</p>

<p>It was a terrible conflict! The balloon
tried to rise, but the trees held us back and
the car was dragged over the trees, bounding,
smashing, and annihilating everything
it met in its frantic course.</p>

<span class="subhead">THE FALL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> danger was here, and our position
seemed absolutely desperate. Death
is not the most fearful thing in the destinies
of man. It was when we first embarked
on the “Vauban” that we offered the
sacrifice of our lives, knowing perfectly
well that we were exposing ourselves to
the danger of falling on the road. We had,
therefore, foreseen the possibility of death;
but to die torn by a blind force, to be
dragged over trees and not to know if the
branches will first wrench off your head
or your arms, is a thing more painful than
death. And there was no physical power
nor intelligence&mdash;no means whatever which
might save us. We had nothing to fall
back on, absolutely nothing but hazard, as
blind as the force which was playing with
our existence. The situation caused a
strange thing to happen in my imagination,
which I have never been able to explain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
and which I should like at this point to
describe.</p>

<p>For a few moments I had a sort of
vision. There is nothing extraordinary in
this. It can be easily explained. But what
I at least find more difficult to explain and
what up till now I have never been able to
understand is that I was at the same time
absolutely and entirely master of myself, in
full control of my intelligence, my will, and
my self-command. I felt the vision, knowing
that it was a vision, as an interested
observer of an extraordinary phenomenon.</p>

<p>This is what I <span class="locked">saw:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I was back in my birthplace, in my
father’s house. The big parlour was lit
up as if for some festival. The room was
full of people; all my family, as well as my
boyhood’s friends and companions, were
around me.</p>

<p>My mother was among them, beautiful
but pale, and she kissed me and cried.
My dear father, who has since left us and
now rests in eternity, my little sister, my
brothers, and everyone, thronged round me
and I said good-bye to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
It was dark outside, but the big chandelier
shed its light on this numerous concourse.
They were all in holiday attire,
but it was a silent festival and the only
voice was the caressing one of my mother,
who said to me: “Don’t leave me yet.”...
“No, Mother.” And then the vision
vanished.</p>

<p>If I had not the most indisputable proof
that at the moment when I had this vision
I was absolutely cool and in control of my
faculties, there would be nothing extraordinary
in this and it might be easily
explained by my nervous state and by the
fatigue and over-excitement of the journey.</p>

<p>But I looked at the vision simply as a
vision, taking my part in it, but knowing
at the same time that it was a chimera
and that I was perfectly calm and self-controlled.
My intelligence and my powers
of comprehension were absolutely lucid,
and here is the <span class="locked">proof:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>From the moment that I saw the first
impact of the car against the trees threatening,
I thought of a plan for protecting
myself, which both argued that my wits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
were at work and required presence of
mind.</p>

<p>Anyone who has seen a balloon will
know that between the gas-bag and the car
there is a solid ring of wood to one side of
which the gas-bag is attached, the other side
supporting the car. This wooden ring is
called the “crown” and is between the
balloon and the basket, which are both
strongly roped to it.</p>

<p>Now the crown, by reason of its being
between the two rope attachments, is the
best place of refuge from a crash which
must necessarily be considerably broken
after being transmitted over the ropes to
the crown, particularly as the latter is a
considerable distance from the car. In
order to reach it one has to get up on the
seat and hoist oneself along the ropes from
the edge of the basket to the crown,
which is several metres distant.</p>

<p>As soon as I saw that there was no more
hope of maintaining ourselves in the air and
that our car was inevitably bound to crash
against the summits of the trees, I jumped
on the seat and climbed up to the crown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
The formation of this plan and its rapid
execution in the exact moment of danger
was sufficient proof of my presence of mind
at the moment of our fall and of the vision
which accompanied it. I even remember
that I laughed at a remark, which really
was laughable, of my companions in
distress.</p>

<p>When they saw me climb on to the seat,
and from there to the side of the basket,
in order to swarm up the ropes to the
crown, they asked me in all seriousness if
I was going to get out. The question made
me laugh. There was really something
comical in the contrast between our situation
and my friend’s question. To get out
of a balloon in motion which is about to
fall upon the spiked branches of a forest!
They had asked me seriously, and with a
certain amount of anxiety: “Are you going
to get out?...” “No,” said I, and
laughed. “Where do you want me to
go?” It was at that moment that I saw
my vision.</p>

<p>But to go back to our descent. The
balloon, which thus dragged us over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
trees, had kept all its power, for it was
still filled with gas, and might drag us a
long time yet.</p>

<p>What could we do? Opening the valve
would by no means have stopped it, as
it would have taken too much time and
the gas would not have escaped quickly
enough. We therefore decided to cut the
ropes which bound the car to the crown
in order to separate it from the infuriated
balloon.</p>

<p>The good sailor took out his trusty axe,
but scarcely had he given the first cut
when the balloon succeeded in disengaging
the basket from the branches which held
it back and impeded its course. It then
recommenced its flight, rising like an eagle
towards higher regions.</p>

<p>We were stupified. So we were to have
a new journey and fresh adventures!</p>

<p>Fortunately it was not one of long duration.
The wind and the rain whipped the
balloon from all sides and prevented it
from regaining its original vigour and
mounting higher. Then a last struggle
engaged between the balloon and the storm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
which had continued raging. The balloon,
once free, tried to rise, but was held back
by the extreme violence of the tempest.
In its struggles it leapt and bounded,
making us fear at any moment that the
basket would upset and precipitate its
contents pell-mell into space. Twice a
squall threw us to the ground&mdash;that is to
say, into the trees&mdash;and twice the unexhausted
strength of the balloon snatched
us from their branches. A third, more
violent, gust enveloped the balloon entirely,
bent it to the ground in front
of the car, and hurled it against a large
and magnificent oak&mdash;which I can see
to-day before my eyes. We were in
safety&mdash;the balloon gave the expiring yell
of a strong fabric torn by violent explosion.
It burst, rent along its side,
and hung in a thousand enormous rags
against the ancient branches of the great
oak which had destroyed it.</p>

<p>We were at once enveloped by clouds
of gas escaping from the disembowelled
balloon. In a moment all was over. The
car had stopped and we were safe. My<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
watch pointed to one o’clock when I
jumped down from the tree.</p>

<p>But in what part of the country were
we? Whose was the wood which protected
us? Should we meet Frenchmen
or had we fallen into the enemy’s country?
That old navigator Ulysses, when he walked
on the beach of Ithaca, was not more
ignorant of his fate than we when we left
our car in the branches of the trees in
which it remained captive.</p>

<span class="subhead">AN ENCOUNTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> a rule I am bad at topography,
and do not easily find my way in
places that I see for the first time. But
my faculties had been made keen by danger
during our aerial voyage and my sustained
attention remembered everything that my
eyes had seen.</p>

<p>The second time the balloon rose above
the forest I had, from my elevated perch,
observed a fairly broad path across the
wood, which looked as if it might lead to
some neighbouring village. I kept this
path in my memory and, while our balloon
was engaged in its last struggle, I tried to
take note of our movements in order not
to lose the direction of this path. So much
so that, when at last we touched the ground,
I was able to find it.</p>

<p>I left my companions to watch near the
wrecked balloon and bent my steps to the
left in order to find the way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
I had not been mistaken. After walking
for scarcely ten minutes, I found the path
I was looking for. Happy at my discovery,
I was about to return through the wood to
tell my companions, when I saw a man
leave the thicket on the other side of the
road and come towards me.</p>

<p>What manner of man was this, and what
did he want with me? What singular
chance had driven him to this wood in
such weather?</p>

<p>It was still raining in torrents. Instead
of returning through the undergrowth,
as I had intended, to find my fellow-travellers,
I made as if I were looking for
shelter from the rain, and stood with my
back against a tree.</p>

<p>In this position I could wait for the
unknown to come up, and could examine
him while he crossed the road to reach me.</p>

<p>He at once came forward. He was well
dressed and had the appearance of a man
of means. He looked neither like a peasant
nor like a dweller in large towns, and it
was difficult to guess exactly what kind
of individual I had to deal with. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
seemed, however, to be looking for me,
for he walked directly towards me and
crossed the path, bearing towards the point
where I was standing.</p>

<p>What was this man, friend or enemy?
What could I say to him, and how should
I speak to him, in French or in German?</p>

<p>I thought it would be best not to say
anything and to wait till he addressed me.
“Bon jour, Monsieur,” said he, on coming
up. I returned his greeting.</p>

<p>“Have you been here long?” he asked
me.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Where have you come from?” he continued.</p>

<p>I began to be reassured and noticed that
my unknown spoke with the Alsatian
accent. But the Alsatian accent is very
similar to the German, and was not Alsace
entirely occupied by the enemy?</p>

<p>Such were my thoughts on hearing him,
and instead of answering his question, I
asked him point-blank, “Are you French,
Monsieur?” And as I asked I looked him
well in the face and did not take my eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
from his, trying to read into his soul.
“Oui, Monsieur,” was his answer, and the
“Oui, Monsieur” was pronounced simply
and with a frankness that concealed
nothing and invited confidence.</p>

<p>I felt he had spoken the truth. I held
out my hand and said: “Well, Monsieur,
I am also a Frenchman. We have come
from Paris and our balloon has just come
down in this forest....”</p>

<p>“Oh, is that you! Good God, what
sufferings you must have undergone! I
have watched you battling with the storm
for at least half an hour. My friends and
I came out to beat the forest in order to
find you and help you, for we foresaw a
catastrophe.”</p>

<p>I was profoundly touched, and heartily
wrung his hand....</p>

<p>“But where are we?”</p>

<p>“At Vigneulles in the Meuse; this is the
wood of Vigneulles, the village is three
kilometres away, and behind the wood, a
league from here, are the Prussians. They
came into the village yesterday morning.”
After saying this he gave a signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
by whistling in a particular manner, and
I at once saw ten or twelve peasants
running up from different part of the wood.
He explained our situation to them and
gave them orders. While they went off
to find my companions and the débris
of the balloon, I followed my new guide
towards the village in order to lose no
time in preparing a way to leave the district
as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>My mentor took me to the Mairie, a little
house in the village, comprising the offices
and the personal residence of the Mayor,
the latter on the first-floor.</p>

<p>The behaviour of this village worthy was
in singular contrast with that of the brave
man who had brought me to him. He
trembled when he heard that Frenchmen,
coming from Paris, and recently descended
from a balloon, were there, and he asked
himself whether he could and ought for a
single moment to shelter them. “If the
Prussians hear that I have received them
I am lost....”</p>

<p>I will pass quickly over the painful scene
which followed. The poor man is since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
dead, and I only speak of the incident in
order to show that the devoted efforts of
our guide to carry us to the Belgian frontier
were not without risk to himself. His name
is Julien Thiébeaux; he was at that time
employed in the Excise Department and
has since been promoted to a Collectorship.
He was a brave man and a good citizen.</p>

<p>When he saw the Mayor’s disposition
towards ourselves, he said to me: “You
can’t remain here, Monsieur, as the Prussians
are encamped close at hand. They
were here yesterday and may be here again
to-morrow. They may come at any
moment, even while we are speaking. I
wanted to let the Mayor have the honour
of saving you, and for that reason have
said nothing; but the time has now
come to act. Will you trust yourselves
to me?”</p>

<p>I looked at the speaker and fixed my eyes
on him a second time, trying to penetrate
and read his secret thoughts from his countenance.
He will pardon me for this last
trace of suspicion, as will those who read
these lines; it was not unnatural.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
We were in the midst of a Prussian
encampment, and the Mayor of the village
had shown his sentiments in most unambiguous
fashion; he had not the slightest
desire to risk his neck in order to save
some unknown men, who had been wrong-headed
enough, according to him, to cross
the Prussian lines in a balloon, and to drop
exactly into his unfortunate village, which
had all the best reasons in the world to
live on good terms with the enemy’s army....
And then appears a simple villager,
the first-comer as it were, and one who
has no reason to interfere in a nasty
business which does not concern him, and
offers his services spontaneously and light-heartedly
without being asked by anyone,
in order to save three unknown men from
under the Prussians’ noses! By doing so
he was exposing himself, when he returned
from his expedition on the morrow, to a
reward at the hands of the enemy whose
nature could not be doubted.</p>

<p>Such were the thoughts in my mind while
M. Thiébeaux explained how urgent it was
that we should leave, and offered to conduct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
us to the frontier through the Prussian
army.</p>

<p>So I again inspected M. Thiébeaux, and
not without suspicion.</p>

<p>But the more I looked at him the further
did suspicion fly from my mind. He had
a frank and honest eye and a simple and
natural attitude. Such clear signs of
sincerity and loyalty emanated from his
whole person that my doubts ceased, and
I felt remorse at having for a single
moment suspected the sincerity of his
devotion.</p>

<p>He had finished his little speech by asking
the simple question, “Will you trust yourselves
to me?” I held out my hand, and
said, “Shake, M. Thiébeaux, and let us start.”</p>

<p>“But I do not want to start alone,” he
said. “I have a friend who knows
the way better than I, and we shall have
need of him. I will answer for him. May
I bring him with me?”</p>

<p>A little later my companions and I were
seated with our brave guides in a little
country carriage and making for the
Belgian frontier.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Vigneulles is in the Meuse, at the entrance
to the great plain which is known
as the “Grande Woëvre.” This was the
scene of the memorable battles of the 16th
and 18th of August, 1870, the battles which
are called Mars-la-Tour, Rezonville, Gravelotte
and Saint-Privat.<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> The little village
lies between Verdun and Metz, and is about
forty kilometres distant from the latter.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_B" id="Footnote_B" href="#FNanchor_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> <span class="smcap">Note</span>:&mdash;It is also the scene of very serious fighting
at the present moment (Feb., 1915). Vigneulles
is a few miles from the German position at St. Mihiel.</p></div>

<p>This enabled us to calculate the path we
must have taken in our balloon.</p>

<p>The distance from Paris to Metz is about
four hundred kilometres, but our balloon
did not take a direct course. During the
first part of our journey we went persistently
in an opposite direction&mdash;that is to
say, towards the west of France&mdash;and it
was only when the storm commenced,
which was about 11 o’clock in the morning,
that the wind must have shifted and
carried us towards the east.</p>

<p>It was not yet 11 o’clock when I had
expressed a desire to come down on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>great plain which offered us such an immense
and propitious terrain for coming
to earth. The wind had at that time not
yet changed, and we could hope to come
down in the fertile plains of Normandy or
possibly in the direction of Brittany. Our
aeronaut did not share my point of view,
and we continued our journey. It was
only then, after two hours navigation, that
the weather changed. So it is evident that
the balloon must have traversed at least
twice the distance between Paris and Metz,
since it had travelled for two hours at full
speed in an opposite direction. The whole
journey had been carried out in the space
of four hours&mdash;from nine in the morning
till one in the afternoon. That represented
an amazing speed: two or three hundred
kilometres an hour.</p>

<p>And now for the Belgian frontier!</p>

<span class="subhead">EN ROUTE FOR THE FRONTIER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> distance we now had to go was
very much shorter, but it was also
more difficult, and we only arrived at the
frontier the next morning, between ten and
eleven. Had it not been for the intelligence
and devotion of M. Thiébeaux and his
friend M. Charles Jeannot, we should not
have arrived at all.</p>

<p>It was a long, slow and painful journey,
a regular Odyssey, across country entirely
occupied by the enemy.</p>

<p>It is not my purpose in this short narrative
to tell of its events and adventures ...
that would take us too far and would only
serve to revive sad memories. I only refer
to it in token of gratitude to our courageous
guides who carried us by night under a
drenching rain through the lines of the
army of occupation with no less intelligence
than courage and presence of mind. It is
clear that the Germans saw our balloon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
as well as M. Thiébeaux and his friends,
and they at once set out to capture it.
Fortunately for ourselves the forest and
the rain prevented their following our
movements and taking exact note of the
place where we had come down.</p>

<p>At midnight we met some of M. Thiébeaux’
friends on the road, returning from
a neighbouring fair. “Anything new?”
asked our guide.</p>

<p>“Yes, a balloon has come from Paris.
There were three or four persons in it,
and the Uhlans are after them.”</p>

<p>“In which direction have they gone?”</p>

<p>“I believe they are pursuing them in
the direction of Verdun.”</p>

<p>“Are there any Prussians in the neighbourhood
of...?”</p>

<p>“No, they are at ... to-day.”</p>

<p>“Good-night.”</p>

<p>Our carriage again moved off, while M.
Thiébeaux’ friends began to interrogate us
as to whether there was anything new on
our side. The place where the Uhlans
were hoping to catch us was in exactly
the opposite direction to the way we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
now going, and M. Thiébeaux rubbed his
hands with pleasure at the knowledge that
they were on a false scent.</p>

<p>At eight in the morning we arrived at
Montmédy.</p>

<p>There we learnt the sad news of the
surrender of Metz.</p>

<p>We were not far from the frontier, and
crossed it an hour later, subsequently arriving
at Virton, a little Belgian town which
was swarming with French. Here we said
good-bye to M. Thiébeaux and his friend
M. Jeannot and took the first diligence for
the nearest station on the Luxemburg railway,
by which we arrived at ten or eleven
at night at Brussels.</p>

<p>If I were to let myself be carried away
by my memories, I would here throw a
sidelight on the remarkable but saddening
aspect of the Belgian capital, which was
the temporary home of so many Frenchmen
and the seat of so many diverse and
conflicting passions, hopes, and fears. But
what would be the use? I will say no
more than that the city of Brussels was
crowded with people. It was full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
Frenchmen and particularly Parisians.
The faces of the stout Flemish burghers
were bright and radiant and broader than
usual; they were delighted with the golden
flow of business, but, none the less, had
no love for the French who brought them
all this gold.</p>

<p>The Belgian capital, which I had often
before visited and which had always
charmed me by its beauty and elegance,
then seemed to me ugly and hateful, and
I only stayed there for as long as was
absolutely necessary to get things in order
for my departure.</p>

<span class="subhead">A SPY AT DIEPPE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Before</span> leaving for Austria, I had to
go to Tours, where the Delegates of
the National Defence Government were at
this time sitting.</p>

<p>I had therefore to go back to France,
and could only do so by going a long way
round. Part of the north was already
occupied. The trains no longer went
regularly, and in order to get from Brussels
to Tours I had to slip through a great
many obstacles and often leave the railway
and have recourse to carriages. There was
no lack of episodes on the road, but they
were not gay ones and I prefer not to
speak about them. The country was in
a fever and disorganised, and to a large
extent occupied and ruined. Where the
enemy had not yet come they were expected,
and the days were anxiously
counted which were to bring the first
Uhlans.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
“Spies” were suspected everywhere,
just as in Paris, where I saw a crowd
gather one night before a house in the
Boulevard Montmartre, and where a cruel
injustice would that night have been committed
if the police had not intervened in
time to clear up the mistake.</p>

<p>There was a light in an attic on the
sixth floor. It was only a poor woman at
work, but she was accused of signalling
with her little lamp from the height of
her attic to the Prussians who were besieging
Paris. The latter were at least
fifteen or twenty miles from the boulevard,
even where their siege-works had approached
our ramparts. So it was simply
ridiculous to suppose that signals could have
been given to the Prussians from a window
in the boulevard. The feeble little light
on the sixth floor, however, was quite
enough to make the passer-by believe that
there was a spy up there communicating
with the enemy and signalling messages to
him. That is the kind of spy mania which
was responsible for yielding me an amusing
quarter of an hour when I least expected it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
The event took place at Dieppe. This
peaceable and innocent little seaside town,
well known to all Parisians, certainly had
no reason to attract the attention of M. de
Moltke and his generals, but it was there
that I was nearly arrested as a vile spy,
by order of the sous-préfet, who no doubt
smelt out an ingenious plan on the part
of the Prussian Field-Marshal for taking
this important fortress without a blow.</p>

<p>I had just arrived in a carriage from
Eu, and had come to Dieppe to take the
train there.</p>

<p>I was waiting for the time when the train
was to start, and had gone to the hotel for
lunch in company with the persons who
had come with me, or rather, who had
brought me in their carriage, very kindly
putting it at my disposal because for the
moment there was no other means of communication
between Eu and Dieppe.</p>

<p>I had scarcely sat down to table when
the proprietor came up with a thousand
bows and stammered excuses and told me
that there was someone there ... someone
who ... a gentleman who ... in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
word that there was someone who wanted
to speak to me.</p>

<p>Someone to speak to me at nine in the
morning; me, an unknown, a stranger from
a distance, who had passed the night on
the road and had only just arrived in the
place! It seemed a curious demand and
I foresaw mystery. “Let him come in,” I
said to the proprietor, smiling, for I could
not help being amused at his grave and
embarrassed manner.</p>

<p>The dining-room opened on to a large,
dark corridor which had not been lit up
and in which it was difficult to distinguish
what was happening. My host rushed
into the corridor and disappeared in the
darkness.</p>

<p>There was a moment of deep silence,
then hasty footsteps and a confused noise;
I vaguely saw an ill-defined movement, the
gleam of weapons, arms waving in the thick
of the darkness, advancing footsteps! At
last a figure appeared out of the background
and drew near; then a mad burst
of laughter and these words: “Is that you,
Reitlinger? What a joke!” And when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the speaker came out waving his long
arms, from the dark corridor where he
was standing with his armed men, I recognised
an old friend: it was one of the most
charming sub-prefects in the provinces, one
who was the ornament of the “parquet”
at Dieppe and whom I had known when
he was studying in Paris. He sat down
at my table and told me that he had
come purely and simply in order to
lock up my dangerous person and prevent
me from doing a hurt to the National
Defence!</p>

<p>The supreme authorities of Dieppe had
been informed that the Secretary of the
Government was at the hotel. The sous-préfet
had pricked up his ears at this
report, shrugged his shoulders, shaken his
head and considered, incredulity in his
soul! The Secretary of the Government?
... an invention, a clumsy imposture!
Was the Government not at Paris? Was
not Paris besieged by the Prussians?
Would not the Prussians have intercepted
this Secretary?</p>

<p>That is not the way to humbug authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
who watch over the town and district
with a vigilant and circumspect eye!</p>

<p>This Secretary is simply a spy and he
covers himself with the name of the
Government the better to hide his schemes,
the better to betray the poor town of
Dieppe, and carry away the plans of its
fortifications with greater security. Let us
put him under lock and key.</p>

<p>The “parquet” had been hastily assembled,
and the “parquet,” full of admiration
for the perspicacity of the sous-préfet,
had ordered out its <i>posse</i>, while the latter
promptly headed the expedition to assure
himself of my person. My sous-préfet was
the first to laugh at this deployment of
armed force and his own haste in taking
part in such an adventure.</p>

<p>“Now that the security of our country
permits it,” said he, “I will send back my
braves and we will drink to the success of
your mission.”</p>

<p>This was excellent, but I asked myself
what would have happened if the task
of arresting me had been entrusted to
one who did not happen to know me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
personally. Would M. le Sous-Préfet have
kept me under lock and key, or would
I have been obliged to show him the
Minister’s confidential letters accrediting
me for my mission?</p>

<span class="subhead">ACROSS GERMANY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">My</span> first stopping-place was the Grand
Duchy of Baden, then Wurtemburg
and, finally, Bavaria. I was everywhere
able to confirm that our Government
had received untrue reports and even untruer
interpretations with regard to these
countries.</p>

<p>It was true that everyone was weary
of the war and the sacrifices of men and
money which the country was making;
everyone deplored the complete stoppage
of industry and commerce, and the misery
which was its consequence, and everyone
ardently desired the end of these sufferings
and the rapid, the immediate conclusion
of peace.</p>

<p>But on what conditions?</p>

<p>Did it mean that this ardently desired
peace would be accepted on any conditions
and at any price?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
On this capital point people in France
had the fondest illusions, and found themselves
most completely mistaken.</p>

<p>Yes, they wanted peace, but they wanted
it at the price of a good ransom which
would permit the German Government to
indemnify all those who had suffered
damage either directly or indirectly from
the war. Nor was that all. Besides a
money indemnity, all were unanimous in
demanding as “guarantees for the future”
the cession of Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p>That is the manner of peace they wanted,
and if all Germany was tired of the war
and desired its ending, all Germany considered
it a crime on the part of France
not to consent and not to understand that
the hour had struck for her to surrender
at discretion.</p>

<p>People were exasperated with France
for prolonging a hopeless struggle and by
her obstinacy preventing a conclusion of
peace for which the world had an immense
need. In such a sense as this Germany
was tired of the war, and had it been
necessary to send even more soldiers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
augment the million combatants already on
French soil, had it been necessary to raise
and again raise new levies in order to
arrive at the goal, all Germany without
exception&mdash;north, south, east, and west&mdash;would
have given its last man capable of
bearing arms.</p>

<p>I will even go further. Supposing for
a moment&mdash;such a supposition has no kind
of foundation, but suppose for a single
moment&mdash;that if Prussia or one or other
of her allies had desired the end of the
war under conditions that were easier for
France, and supposing they had attempted
to establish this view in the United Council
of Ministers, public opinion would have
swiftly reduced such a proposition to
silence. The first Government to have
attempted an enterprise of such a nature
would have immediately been overturned
by the general indignation of the whole
people, who would have risen against it
as a single man.</p>

<p>A king or prince liberal enough to have
proposed such a peace would have been
driven out as a traitor to his country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
as unworthy to sit henceforward on the
throne of his august ancestors.</p>

<p>M. de Bismarck knew his people well,
and expressed an indisputable truth when
he told M. Jules Favre, at the interview
of Ferrières, that the King himself could
not conclude peace without the cession of
Alsace and Lorraine.</p>

<p>This feeling, far from being weakened
since that time, had only been increased
and strengthened. The longer the war
lasted, and the greater the sacrifices that
it imposed, the greater and the stronger
also grew the general opinion of Germany
that peace must be concluded solely in
return for, over and above a large ransom,
the cession of these two provinces, Alsace
and Lorraine, which were regarded as
German, and, above all, as a necessary
rampart against France.</p>

<p>Here and there, of course, scattered and
lost among the crowd, there were a few
philosophers whose dreams were in more
elevated spheres and who did not wish to
admit the right to annex a country by the
brutal path of arms and conquest, at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
rate without consulting its population....
But who would listen to them? Who took
them seriously? They were regarded as
Idealists, only to be laughed at; they were
accused of madness, and if they had really
been thought to be of sound mind, they
could not have failed to be treated as
traitors to their country.</p>

<p>I spoke with many individuals between
the Rhine and the Danube, but I never met
anyone who would have consented to a
peace without territorial gains. Even those
whom I had formerly known as “Liberalists”
and belonging to the “Republican
Party” were no exception, and energetically
insisted on annexation. The fact is
that the situation had changed since the
month of July of the “année terrible.”
At the beginning of the war&mdash;as I have
already remarked&mdash;a good part of Prussia’s
allies were lukewarm enough, but later on
enthusiasm had become general.</p>

<p>I was told an incident which seems
characteristic. I will cite it as I heard
it, without comment and without guaranteeing
its authenticity. The King of X.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
who did not love the new régime, who
suffered cruelly from it in his own capital
and who did not wish to let his authority
over his own army be taken away from
him, was ready to cry with vexation when
he was asked for the last reinforcements
to be despatched to the theatre of war. He
would like to have refused them, but dared
not do so. Shutting himself up in his
palace, he refused to see his troops at their
departure defiling with music across the
public square in front of his palace.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But the whole of Germany had become
drunk with the unheard-of, unhoped-for
success of its arms, and this success exalted
the different populations all the more that
it had been greater than they had dared to
hope for when the war began.</p>

<p>Up to that time France had been a
formidable and much-feared power. The
“<i>Rothosen</i>,” or “Red Breeches,” were regarded
beyond the Rhine as invincible
soldiers. At the news of the declaration
of war, the various peoples were at first
in great anxiety; everyone expected to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
the French arrive from one day to the
other.</p>

<p>If at that moment, I repeat, we had
pushed vigorously forward instead of
groping about and letting the enemy have
time to concentrate his troops, take the
initiative, and throw his soldiers in his
turn on to our soil, the war would perhaps
have taken another complexion, in spite of
the wonderfully prepared plans of M. de
Moltke.</p>

<p>A swift march to the Rhine, a vigorous
advance beyond the frontier, carrying our
arms beyond the river into the midst of
German soil, would have produced an immense
impression, and would have thrown
doubt and hesitation among the allies of
Prussia. Perhaps the whole campaign might
have turned in favour of France.</p>

<p>I have no intention of here trespassing
on military ground, where even those more
competent than I are not always in agreement.
But I can certainly bear witness,
for it is the exact truth, that the anxiety
of all sections of the German population
was great, and that, when the news of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
first victories arrived, one could not believe
them, but rather considered them as
miracles and attributed them to the Divine
Justice which wished to punish “impious”
France, the hereditary enemy of Germany,
for having forced a quarrel on her and
having without serious reason begun this
terrible war. Once the first victories were
won, there was no limit to the rejoicings,
and as success increased and was accentuated,
when one battle after the other was
won and the German armies advanced
in numbers and irresistibly on to French
territory, this immense, matchless, and unprecedented
victory produced an equally
immense change in public opinion. What,
was France letting herself thus be beaten?
France, who had set the ball rolling, France,
who had menaced the security of Germany
for a century and who would always
menace it, if Germany did not profit by
the opportunity and take her precautions!</p>

<p>And so, from the depths of the German
mind, the idea had arisen which M. de
Bismarck expressed so vigorously and insistently
to M. Jules Favre in the interview<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
at Ferrières, the idea which had
stiffened the king’s back and resulted in
the interview being fruitless. “We must
have guarantees for the future,” and the
more they saw the rapidity and persistence
of their success, the more did they
become attached to this idea: “We must
have guarantees.”</p>

<p>Guarantees!</p>

<p>And they insisted on having for “guarantees”
what was directly contrary to all
guarantee, for who can deny to-day that
Alsace-Lorraine is the only obstacle, and
a permanent obstacle, to a durable peace
between the two nations? But at that
moment the most far-seeing could not
see this; their eyes were blinded by success,
their spirit was drunken with military glory
and the desire to use their strength up to
the hilt and without consideration for the
future.</p>

<p>After the surrender of Metz, where the
last soldiers of France had given up their
arms and gone as prisoners of war into
German fortresses, one hoped that the war
would be finished and the signing of peace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
would only be the work of a few days
or weeks. But as the days and weeks
passed, and as Paris was “obstinate” in
its resistance and the provinces continued
arming and defending themselves, in a word
as one arrived at the certainty that France
would not surrender and that after the
defeat of her armies it was still necessary
to conquer the “nation” and invade the
entire country, then passion and impatience
were born. An immense anger seized all
Germany; her rulers, her thinkers, her
writers, the whole people, all those who
wielded the pen or the sword, all who
lived and breathed, united in a single
thought, and proclaimed and repeated this
formula of M. de Bismarck: “We must
have guarantees for the future.”</p>

<p>So much so that when history in the
last instance judges and declares this annexation
as one of the greatest mistakes
of our century, history will be obliged
to state that the entire German nation
forced the hands of their Government to
commit it.</p>

<p>Since France had commenced this “impious”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
war, and “Divine Justice” had
granted victory, and an immense, a prodigious
victory, one had to have guarantees
for the future against the chances of a
future attack. The sacrifices that had been
made must not be lost to “the children.”
Future generations must be sheltered from
the chances of new provocations on the
part of France, in case the latter should
ever again wish to declare war.</p>

<p>Such was the exact public opinion of
Germany, and that is why it was impossible
to arrive at peace without the surrender
of Alsace and Lorraine, if France
and Germany were to remain alone on
the bloody field to conclude it, and if the
Powers were to refuse to intervene against
German demands and to force her to modify
them.</p>

<p>From Munich, my last stopping-place, I
went direct to Vienna.</p>

<span class="subhead">IN AUSTRIA</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">From</span> the first day of my arrival, it
was clear to me that the good people
of Austria were with us in their hearts and
were praying for our success&mdash;but that was
all. Our Ambassador, who was to present
me to the Imperial Chancellor, did not
leave me in ignorance that the Imperial
Court had made its decision, and that I
could obtain nothing from the Austrian
Cabinet. The latter was firmly resolved
not to depart from the most strict and
absolute neutrality.</p>

<p>I was not long in convincing myself that
this information was perfectly accurate
and, at my first interview with M. de
Beust, at that time Imperial Chancellor, I
became assured that Austria was not in a
condition to accord the effective intervention
necessary to carry weight with
Germany.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
I have purposely said that Austria was not
in a condition to, that she <i>could</i> not intervene
effectively, because this was the truth
and because if I said that she <i>would</i> not
do so, it would perhaps be doing her an
injustice. It was not the goodwill that
was lacking, but the power.</p>

<p>That was exactly the great misfortune
of our situation; not a single power in
Europe was prepared for any kind of
action: none was in a position for action.</p>

<p>In 1870 Europe was not expecting war.
Among all the living and active nations,
from the Ocean to the Ural Mountains,
from the Mediterranean to the North Pole,
only one Power was on the watch and
getting ready. Only one Power was prepared
at the moment of shock, and that
Power was exactly the one which France,
herself unready, had chosen for an enemy.
Outside Prussia no one in Europe had foreseen
war, and no one was armed or in
condition for a campaign.</p>

<p>The declaration of war in 1870 had
burst unexpectedly in the midst of peaceable
Europe like a thunder-clap which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
shakes the earth in the middle of a calm
spring day.</p>

<p>All the Powers of Europe were enjoying
a complete rest. Their armies scarcely
existed, their soldiers were on furlough and
working quietly in fields and workshops.
Contingents had been reduced. All lived
in peace and security. Prussia herself had
diminished her standing army, and it was
only due to her prodigious military organisation
that she was able to assemble her
forces with hitherto unknown rapidity.</p>

<p>So France was alone in presence of her
enemy. She was isolated in Europe, not
only from the diplomatic but also from the
military point of view. When the combat
turned into defeat for the armies which
Europe had always regarded as legions
of victory, panic seized the minds of all.
Europe, which had not armed <i>before</i> the
declaration of war, because there was no
cloud on the political horizon to menace
general peace, now, after the sanguinary
battles and great successes of Prussia,
did not dare to arm, because she did
not want to provoke France’s conqueror,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
now become the all-powerful arbiter of
Europe.</p>

<p>How often during this painful journey
did I not hear the characteristic remark:
“We cannot mobilize a single soldier without
exposing ourselves....” The <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quos
ego</i> of the conqueror paralysed Europe.</p>

<p>Austria was no better prepared than
other nations. Consequently she was not
in a condition to intervene in the conflict
more effectively than by diplomatic intervention.
And diplomatic intervention was
bound to be useless, since Prussia had
formally declared that she would not accept
the mediation of any Power, and that she
would deal direct with France for the conclusion
of peace.</p>

<p>I was excellently received by M. le Comte
de Beust. He welcomed me frankly and
cordially, and did not attempt to conceal
his views. His first words convinced me
that I was speaking to a sincere friend
of France&mdash;but to an impotent friend.</p>

<p>The interview, therefore, which lasted
more than an hour, resembled a familiar
conversation rather than a diplomatic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
conference, and I shall never forget the
eagerness and, shall we say, the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">laisser
aller</i>” of the Imperial Chancellor, who seemed
to seize with pleasure an opportunity which
allowed him to say what he thought of
the war, of the Imperial Government
that had provoked it, and of the situation
in France since the surrender of Metz.</p>

<p>He was sincerely sorry for the defeat
of France, but it did not astonish him,
for he knew well that Prussia had long
been prepared for this war, and he had
never ceased, while there was still time,
from warning those who then ruled
France. But his good advice had found
no hearing.</p>

<p>He was full of admiration for the resistance
of Paris and the splendid spirit of
the provinces, but he was afraid that all
these prodigious efforts would have no
success. “The best thing you can do,”
said he, “would be to conclude peace as
promptly as possible.” And he repeatedly
cited the example of his own country and
reminded me of what Austria had done
after the disastrous Battle of Sadowa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
I find it difficult to describe the insistence
and animation with which he showed that
all further efforts must be hopeless, and
that there was nothing left but to accept
the evidence and conclude peace without
prolonging our resistance.</p>

<p>“The more you delay the more you are
weakening yourselves&mdash;without speaking of
the irritation you are causing the enemy,
who will augment his demands as he
advances his troops further and further
into the heart of the country. Take the
advice of a sincere friend of France; surrender
and make peace.”</p>

<p>I did not hide from him that France
had not yet reached the extremity of concluding
peace at any cost or under any
conditions which the conqueror would
impose on us.</p>

<p>“It is quite true we have lost our last
army at Metz; but Paris, the great city, can
hold out for a long time yet. Paris will
stop the enemy and give the provinces a
chance of forming new troops.”</p>

<p>He shook his head and said simply:
“You can no longer stop the invasion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
it is better for you to surrender to-day
than to-morrow.”</p>

<p>I then told him that the Powers also were
interested in the result of this war, because
the equilibrium of Europe and their own
security was menaced by the weakening of
France and the undue aggrandisement of
Prussia. “Is it not true that Europe has
need of France, and of an unlessened, unmutilated
France, in its own interests and
in order to establish the balance of power
in face of the menacing superiority of
Prussia?</p>

<p>“In their own interests the Powers ought
to cast aside their apathy and leave their
rôle of quiet spectator in order to raise
their voices and signify to Prussia that all
Europe wishes this war terminated by a
durable peace, by a peace which France
can whole-heartedly accept. I find it difficult
to assume that Prussia, victorious as
she is, can disregard such intervention.”</p>

<p>M. de Beust answered me, smiling delicately
and almost bitterly. “Is that what
you think?” said he. “Well, you are
mistaken; Prussia will listen to no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
in Europe. She will be influenced by
nothing except the number of soldiers
whom Europe can send to the theatre
of war, and Europe has none to send.”</p>

<p>The conversation had arrived at this
point, and the Chancellor was speaking to
me so openly and frankly, in language so
free from reticence and reserve,&mdash;that I
answered him in the same open manner.</p>

<p>I told him that I had just traversed
a large part of Germany and that I was
perfectly informed as to the situation.
“With one hundred thousand men,” I said,
“you could take Berlin.” “Perhaps that
is true,” he answered, “but Russia would
then send two hundred thousand men into
Austria.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That was the situation in Europe.</p>

<p>As regards our attitude towards Prussia,
he found that we were lacking in cleverness.
He was convinced that we were
uselessly stimulating the appetite of our
enemy by our attitude and that we ought
to have said exactly the contrary to what
was the gist of our language to Prussia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
“You make yourselves out too rich,” he
added. “You repeat to M. de Bismarck:
money, as much money as you like, but
no provinces. These are bad tactics! You
do not know your enemy. He will take
both your money and your provinces.</p>

<p>“Tell him, on the contrary, that you
are poor, that the war has exhausted
your resources and that you are no longer
capable of paying a large indemnity. Give
up Alsace. It is an inevitable necessity
and you cannot escape from this calamity.
Who can say what the future has not in
store for us? A province lost is not necessarily
a province lost for ever, while as
to your millions, you will never see them
again.”</p>

<p>He then went on to examine the resources
of Germany in their turn&mdash;and he
knew them well&mdash;and admitting for a
moment the most favourable chances that
could still befall us, M. de Beust, after
having weighed and calculated everything,
concluded as he had commenced. He
thought it impossible to resist the forces
that had invaded France. Any continuation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
of the conflict was a useless sacrifice.
We should only exhaust the country without
being able to hope for any result. And
he sincerely advised us to stop the struggle
and conclude peace as quickly as possible,
because the more we delayed, the greater
would be the demands of the conqueror.
“To-day rather than to-morrow,” said he.
We had already shrunk too long from
facing the facts.</p>

<p>He would have liked to see an assembly
of the Representatives of the Nation, but
he freely admitted that in order to have
elections we should have need of an armistice
and the revictualling of Paris, which
appeared difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>I took the opportunity offered by this
remark to revert to my former demand
for an effective intervention on the part of
Austria in concert with the other Powers.
Commencing with the desirability of convoking
a National Assembly, I went on to
say that an armistice and the revictualling
of Paris, which would have allowed us to
hold elections, were exactly the things that
Prussia had refused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
“Perhaps,” said I, “Prussia may change
her mind on this question and perhaps
also allow of more tolerable conditions
of peace if she sees that France is not
isolated.” And I added that, if my information
was accurate, the populace of
the Austrian Empire was disposed to intervene,
and that public opinion would see
in helping France an opportunity of
avenging Austria’s own defeat of 1866.</p>

<p>The Hungarians in particular had been
reported to me as fervent admirers of
France. They would rise in a body to
help us if the Government did not prevent
them.</p>

<p>But this was far from being M. de Beust’s
view.</p>

<p>There was certainly great and sincere
sympathy for the French cause everywhere
in the Austrian monarchy. But one must
not exaggerate. To conclude from this
that a war against Germany would be a
popular war in Austria would be a great
exaggeration and a great mistake. “Besides,”
said he, lowering his voice, “we
are absolutely lacking in the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
means for a campaign.” And he frankly
explained the whole situation that I have
previously described and everywhere insisted
that: “We are not armed, and it is too
late and too dangerous to mobilise now.”</p>

<p>Before leaving M. de Beust I confessed
to him that my mission did not stop short
with Vienna, but that I was also going to
England. I asked him if he had no message
for me to carry to the English Cabinet,
and if Austria, under certain conditions,
would not take part in common action.</p>

<p>“I authorise you to say to Lord Granville
that, if England wished effectively
to intervene with the object of obtaining
honourable conditions of peace for France,
England would not be alone and Austria
would go with her.”</p>

<p>This answer, which might appear to be
full of promise, did not signify very much
and did not greatly compromise him who
made it, in good faith I admit, but with
the certainty that England would not put
him to the necessity of keeping his word.
The situation, therefore, was one of frightful
simplicity. It was <span class="locked">this:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
If the Powers&mdash;I do not of course refer
to Russia, who was in a situation by herself&mdash;if
the Powers had been able to intervene
for France without exposing themselves
to a war with Prussia, intervention
would have taken place and France would
not have remained alone to face Germany
in negotiating for conditions of peace.</p>

<p>France was, in fact, at this moment in
the position of having regained the sympathies
of those who had turned away from
her at the beginning of the war. Moreover,
the question was being asked with a certain
amount of anxiety whether the crushing
of France would not become a permanent
danger to the general peace. If there had
been any possibility of influencing Prussia’s
determination without the mobilisation of
soldiers, intervention would not have failed
us, and M. de Beust’s answer would not
have been an evasive promise but the
sincere pledge of a friend willing to give
all that circumstances permitted him. I am
inwardly convinced that M. de Beust intended
keeping his word should England
have been able to decide to take a similar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
initiative. But, as we shall see hereafter,
England absolutely refused, and always
for the master reason that she did not
wish to be exposed to a rebuff from
Prussia, who in the last instance would
only have heeded the voice of a general at
the head of an army.</p>

<p>The “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">quos ego’s</i>” of the conqueror held
back Europe&mdash;for, “if Prussia would not
listen, what was then to be done?”</p>

<p>It was thus the fate of France to remain
alone from the beginning of the war to
its close, and Prussia was well aware of
it. She therefore proclaimed, most energetically
and with disdainful pride, to the
whole of Europe that she would not allow
anyone to interfere in her affairs, or to
interpose as mediator between her and
France; peace would be concluded on conditions
which she alone would settle with
France, and Europe had nothing to say
to this arrangement which only concerned
the two principal parties.</p>

<p>And Europe allowed this thing because
she had no means of checking it. She
knew well that words were not enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
for Prussia, and she was not armed so as
to throw her sword if necessary into the
balance in order to give her words weight.</p>

<p>From Vienna I went direct to London,
where I arrived in the first days of
December.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<span class="subhead">LONDON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">In</span> the absence of our Ambassador, the
Embassy in London had been since the
4th of December under the charge of the
First Secretary, and it was this gentleman
who presented me to Lord Granville. He
warned me, just as our Ambassador in
Vienna had done, not to harbour any illusions;
nothing was to be obtained from
England. The English Cabinet was absolutely
decided not to deviate from the
strictest neutrality, and all efforts to make
them leave it would be waste of time.</p>

<p>This was just at the time of a military
event of the greatest importance which
had taken place during the last days of
November.</p>

<p>I refer to the sortie of General Ducrot,
which commenced so gloriously and which
unfortunately so quickly disappointed all
our hopes of a change in the hazard of
arms. To-day the events of this painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
time are far from our minds. The passing
years have robbed them of their intensity.
I should therefore like to write down here,
without making any change, some passages
from my diary, in order to give some
idea of the situation at the beginning of
December.</p>

<p>“... All this was not encouraging.
What was even worse, our affairs, which
had begun to improve with the good news
of Ducrot’s victorious sortie&mdash;a fact which
had accelerated my voyage to London&mdash;have
again fallen into that critical and
distressing situation which inspires Europe
with fear of our enemy and holds aloof
from us all those who admire our resistance
and who would like to see it crowned
with success.</p>

<p>“The ray of sunshine which for a
moment shone on the fate of our arms
has vanished all too soon. The victory
which restored our courage and inflamed
our hopes has lasted all too short a time.</p>

<p>“Already at Rouen, where I spent the
night the day before the Prussians entered
it, alarming rumours were circulating in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
the town, and when I arrived in London
all hope of success was lost!</p>

<p>“Our young and valorous army of the
Loire, which the day before had been still
victorious, was beaten. The army of Paris
had been obliged to abandon the positions
it had bravely conquered in the bloodstained
days of the 29th and 30th of
November. On the 3rd of December it
retreated to Paris.”</p>

<p>This was the military situation when I
went for my first interview with the late
Lord Granville, at that time Minister for
Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>I will not draw a portrait of this
eminent statesman, but would like to indicate
some peculiarities of his manner
of speech, in order to throw light on the
conversation which I am about to describe.</p>

<p>I had been told that Lord Granville was
extremely polite and distinguished, but cold
and chary of speech, and that his caution
was such as sometimes to be taken for
timidity. He spoke little, and easily allowed
the conversation to drop into silence.</p>

<p>If I discovered those good qualities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the English Minister that had been reported
to me, I feel bound to say that I observed
none of those defects of which I had been
warned.</p>

<p>Lord Granville certainly did not like to
waste his time in useless speech, but he did
not allow the conversation to drop when
a serious question was being elucidated,
and he knew how to be eloquent, even
in French. Only occasionally his tongue
stopped suddenly&mdash;he spoke French very
slowly but very correctly&mdash;as if he had
encountered a material obstacle which he
would not or could not overcome.</p>

<p>When I entered the Foreign Office I
entertained no great illusions, but I was
armed with deep confidence and with a
determination that was difficult to subdue.
I had faith in the justice of my cause,
and this faith animated my courage.</p>

<p>What I was about to ask was so just
and reasonable, so in harmony with the
interests of England herself, that in spite
of all that I had been told I still preserved
a spark of hope at the bottom of my heart.</p>

<p>I was at any rate decided not to leave the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Foreign Office before completely exhausting
the question which was the object of my
mission, and I was determined not to leave
without having clearly understood and defined
the attitude towards ourselves that
England proposed to maintain. I had to
know, in a word, what we might hope from
her.</p>

<p>I must say, and I say it with pleasure,
that the eminent statesman was at pains
to facilitate this task. His welcome was
perfect, his language was frank, direct and
courteous, and his answers precise and
complete. At the beginning of our conversation
only, he appeared to me a little
cold and reserved in his answers. But, the
ice once broken, he no longer hesitated to
express all his thoughts. He even seemed
to find pleasure in sounding the situation
with me, so as to leave nothing in doubt
or obscurity.</p>

<span class="subhead">AT THE FOREIGN OFFICE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I</span> began by telling him of the situation
in France, comparing its actual condition
with that of the days before the 4th
of September. I tried to show him what
had been done since the disaster of Sedan,
from the fall of the Empire and the coming
of the Republic till the present moment.</p>

<p>I pointed out&mdash;and he agreed&mdash;that after
Sedan France was face to face with despair.
She was in chaos, in the void; nothing remained;
everything had to be recreated.</p>

<p>Paris was without arms and soldiers.
The provinces were discouraged and denuded
of everything that might allow of
a single day’s resistance. The enemy’s
armies were advancing without obstacle,
invading France town by town, province
by province, devastating the country and
trampling it underfoot....</p>

<p>After this distressing but truthful picture,
this miasma of exhaustion and desolation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
I drew for him a picture of the awakening
of the great nation on the day after the 4th
of September. I described its hope when
there was no more hope, its courage when
courage was madness, its resistance when
all means of resistance were at an end.</p>

<p>I described the whole nation erect, from
Paris down to the smallest hamlet lost in
the mountains, unconquered and unconquerable,
strong and proud and with arms
in its hands. A force had been created out
of nothing, and arms out of the Void.</p>

<p>Lord Granville listened.</p>

<p>He listened long, without making the
slightest movement.</p>

<p>My words became more and more animated.
He followed them, if I may
describe it so, with his eyes....</p>

<p>“You see, M. le Comte,” I said at last,
“you see what we have done, and from
that you can judge what we are still
capable of doing and what we will certainly
do. Paris is determined to undergo
the greatest rigours of war rather than
surrender.</p>

<p>“The provinces, who for a moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
hesitated, plunged as they were in that
evil habit of waiting for everything to
come from above and never undertaking
anything themselves, the provinces also
have awakened to the inspiration of a
powerful genius and have risen as one
man. They also are up and resolute.
They are animated by the same spirit,
penetrated by the same conviction, and
inflamed with the same courage. All
France is in arms. She has lifted high
her flag, on which she has written:
“Victory or death!”</p>

<p>He still listened without a movement.</p>

<p>Had I spoken into space? Was silence
to fall before the conversation had well
commenced?</p>

<p>Was this silence to be interpreted as
approval, or, on the contrary, was the
eminent statesman’s mouth closed by the
painful impression of complete disapprobation?</p>

<p>I looked into his eyes and said: “I have
spoken frankly and sincerely to you, from
the very bottom of my heart; have you no
answer to give me?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
His profound blue eyes rested on mine
for a moment, then he said slowly, almost
stumblingly:</p>

<p>“M. Thiers, who came to see me, has
already spoken to me as eloquently as you
have to-day.</p>

<p>“All that you have done is admirable,
and France has shown an elasticity which
has astonished everyone. I have already
said so to M. Thiers. I repeat it gladly,
and I can add with the utmost sincerity
that our admiration has only augmented
and increased since that time. We have
attempted to intervene in your favour as
much as the situation permitted. We have
done all we could to stop this war, which
we deplore. But we are not listened to.
We have neither the right nor the power
to interfere in an affair which does not
concern us. We desire greatly that the
war should be finished. We have made
many efforts to arrive at least at an armistice,
but the Government in Paris has
refused the armistice which we have tried
to negotiate....”</p>

<p>He again fixed his blue eyes on me as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
if to ask me: “Why has this armistice been
refused?”</p>

<p>It seemed to me to be an unfair question,
and I said with a certain amount of spirit:
“Pardon me, M. le Comte, one cannot
accuse the Government of Paris of rejecting
an armistice and means of coming
to terms. On the contrary, they have done
everything humanly possible to bring it
about, but an armistice without re-victualling&mdash;that
is to say, an armistice with the
prospect of starving Paris out, while
Prussia is recruiting her strength, was
not acceptable, and Prussia refused any
other kind of armistice.”</p>

<p>“This refusal,” said he, mechanically
lowering his eyes, “was not reasonable.
An armistice would have prevented many
inconveniences to Prussia and considerable
difficulties to France, and the Government
could, at any rate, have profited by it to
form a legal representation of the country.”
I was astonished at these words which
appeared to me absolutely unfair.</p>

<p>“What?” said I. “You consider it a
reasonable thing to offer a twenty-five days’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
armistice, without re-victualling, to a town
of two millions which has been besieged
for three months?</p>

<p>“Why, that would be taking away
exactly so many days from the resistance
of this courageous town, which has
shown in its days of misfortune that it
was something more than a city of
pleasure. Prussia’s acceptance of negotiations
for an armistice could have had no
meaning without at least the re-victualling
of the city. By her refusal she has made
the armistice impossible, and on her must
fall the responsibility of breaking off the
negotiations. It is she who has refused
an armistice desired by the whole world.”</p>

<p>“No, it was not unreasonable,” he again
answered me. “Prussia would have lost
much too much during a twenty-five days’
armistice.” And he went on to give the
most detailed reasons why the refusal was
not an “unreasonable” one.</p>

<p>This was his principal <span class="locked">argument:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If the armistice had not been successful
in producing peace, Prussia would have
lost precious time which she would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
been obliged to pass in inaction. She
would thus herself have prolonged the term
of sacrifices and of sufferings which the
war necessarily imposed on her, and she
would have lost this precious time without
any kind of compensation.</p>

<p>“Your Government,” added the noble
lord, “formally instructed M. Thiers to
reject the armistice, so it is not Prussia
that has to be considered responsible.”</p>

<p>It is difficult for two persons to come to
an understanding if they start from such
different points of view that one says to
the other “This is just” where the other
only sees a manifest injustice.</p>

<p>It was easy for me to see that Lord
Granville would depart from none of his
views, and would answer all my arguments
by contrary ones. So it seemed useless to
discuss the point any longer. I contented
myself with saying that the actual Government
of France would have been glad to
convoke a National Assembly to share its
heavy burdens, had they been allowed to
do so.</p>

<p>“The devoted men,” I said, “at the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
of our nation have picked up the fallen
reins of power solely to arm the nation
and organise national defence against the
invasion. They are not ambitious of
honours. They have arrogated to themselves
only the duties of power, and they
have done so with the sole idea of national
defence.</p>

<p>“They would have been glad to convoke
the delegates of the nation and place their
power in the hands of a freely elected
National Assembly, and it is solely and entirely
for this end that they have demanded
an armistice. Perhaps they would have
been content with less than twenty-five
days,” I added, in order to sound Lord
Granville on this question.</p>

<p>This remark was to his liking. He interrupted
me briskly and asked me: “How
many days do you think would be enough
for the elections?”</p>

<p>I answered that, at the narrowest computation
of what was strictly necessary, I
thought that it would take perhaps twelve
to fifteen days to carry out the elections,
but that I was in no sense qualified nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
competent to say so, and this was merely
my personal opinion. “But then,” said
he, “the Government would do well to
proceed to election in this delay and to
ask for a twelve days’ armistice. It would
be a great advantage for you if the country
had a legal representation.”</p>

<p>“Would Prussia accept?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “she would have
accepted any armistice without re-victualling....”
Then, as if he had gone too
far, and, as it were, to correct himself,
he immediately added that of course he
had no means of knowing what were the
dispositions at this moment of the Prussian
General Staff. He did not know whether
they were still inclined to grant an armistice,
and he did not like to promise us
anything with regard to this....</p>

<p>Such was the dominant note I encountered
in all my official conversations:
an unmeasured fear of being exposed and
compromised.</p>

<p>To reassure him I answered: “Do
not think, M. le Comte, that I will take
you at your word. I do not think the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
National Defence Government is willing
to accept the responsibility of an armistice
with the prospect of starving Paris
out, even though it be only for twelve
days.”</p>

<p>“But,” he answered, “since Paris could
hold out a long time yet, as you have
just told me, twelve days cannot hurt her
much and twelve days will give you the
immense advantage of having the country
constitutionally represented.”</p>

<p>He developed the idea that up to the
present the National Defence Government
was only a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i> Government, and that
it would be in its highest interests to have
a National Representative at its side on
which to lean.</p>

<p>I replied that his observation was
subject to correction; that the National
Defence Government was not only a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de
facto</i> Government, but was approved within
the country and recognised without as a
legal and regular government. However,
there was nothing it more ardently desired
than the chance of convoking a National
Assembly. “I will,” I said, “faithfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
transmit your excellent suggestions to my
Government.”</p>

<p>“How can you communicate with the
Government in Paris?” he asked.</p>

<p>I was very glad that he put this question,
for it was my intention to ask him
to intervene so that I might be able to
return to Paris in order to report directly
and personally to my Government all the
information I had gathered since the time
I left.</p>

<p>But as I did not wish to interrupt the
trend of our conversation, I answered that
I should like to speak on this subject later,
before taking my leave, and I asked him
to have the kindness to continue developing
his ideas regarding the question of the
“Representation of the Country.”</p>

<p>Lord Granville then discussed two other
methods of creating what he called the
“legal representation of the country.” In
asking for a “legal” representation he was
above all guided by the following idea,
which seemed to preoccupy him considerably,
for he often came back to it; there
was actually no longer a “legal” authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
in France; there was a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i> Government,
but it had not received legal sanction.</p>

<p>“There is no one,” he repeated, “under
existing conditions, who has the right of
treating in the name of France, and
Prussia would not even know with whom to
come to an understanding when the moment
arrives for discussing conditions of peace.”</p>

<p>It was with this event in view that he
so desired the meeting of a national
assembly. It was no use telling him he
was mistaken&mdash;for I considered it essential
to show him the true situation; he
persisted in his opinion; and these were
the two means which appealed to him
for arriving at the creation of a National
<span class="locked">Representation:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>First of all, he thought, the Conseils
Généraux might furnish a Constitutional
Assembly.</p>

<p>After developing the details of his point
of view and the advantages which were
to be gained from such an Assembly, he
finished his remarks by this question:
“Why will you not have recourse to the
Conseils Généraux?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
I told him that the Conseils Généraux
had no constitutional right to represent
the nation. He seemed to admit
my argument, and reverted to his first
<span class="locked">idea:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“But why not have the Elections without
an armistice?”</p>

<p>His previous remarks, when we were
speaking about M. Thiers, had sufficiently
shown me the gist of his thoughts. He
wanted to see Elections held in France
by any means whatever, even without an
armistice.</p>

<p>I could not accept such a proposition
and I refused to understand how a statesman,
anxious for the dignity as well as
for the material interests of his country
could give such advice. Elections in a
country invaded by the enemy! Elections
under the enemy’s gun-fire! Elections
at a time when every citizen was under
arms against the invader, elections, in a
word, while Prussia was bombarding Paris
and advancing her armies! That was an
idea which I simply could not grasp. I
tried, but in vain, to make him share my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
perplexity. Moreover, I had encountered
the same idea with M. de Beust.</p>

<p>At the time I could not understand it
and it revolted me. To-day I can see how
the idea arose and held its own simultaneously
in the minds of these two
eminent statesmen, who held the reins of
Government in two countries so different
in origin, constitution and tendencies.</p>

<p>The National Defence Government was
only, when all was said and done, a <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de
facto</i> Government.</p>

<p>The men who composed it had picked
up the Executive when it fell from the
Empire’s hands, only for the purpose of
not letting it fall into the gutter, and for
using it to defend the country against the
invaders. These men certainly had the
confidence of Europe, and their Government
was immediately and gladly recognised
by all the Powers; it had been
recognised and respected even by the
enemy.</p>

<p>But side by side with this <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de facto</i>
Executive there also remained the débris
of the fallen Government, which had by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
no means renounced its past, and still
lived in the hope of coming back and
again laying hands on the Crown, which
though fallen they still thought unbroken.</p>

<p>On the other side there were demagogues,
orators and low-class politicians,
all that unhealthy ferment which had
burst out on the 31st of October and
nearly overthrown the National Defence
Government.</p>

<p>The latter, it is true, had conquered this
first revolt, but the pretensions and aspirations
of the party which had caused the
rising were not conquered. They were
only pushed out of the way and reduced
to silence, but they still smouldered in the
ashes and no one knew when they might
not break out afresh, or whether the
Government would again be as fortunate
in reducing them to impotence and maintaining
its authority.</p>

<p>This is what seriously preoccupied
foreign statesmen and inspired them
with the idea of creating a “legal representative,”
in any manner whatever, by
any means and at any price. Above all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
they wanted to guard against unexpected
surprises. Before all and above all they
wanted to have an authority to deal with,
which was not only a Government <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">de
facto</i> but a Government that had been
consecrated&mdash;even if only apparently&mdash;by
the votes of the French people, and that
could by that token be accepted by all
parties and be safe from sudden attacks
and ambushes. This is why Lord Granville
first asked me to have recourse to
the Conseils Généraux of the Empire, and
when I showed him the impossibility of
such a solution, this is why he suggested
that we should simply hold the Elections
without any armistice, by carrying them
through as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>I should have liked to show him again
how unfair and impossible I considered
his proposition, but it would have been
preaching in the wilderness, and so all
I said was: “What would you do in the
provinces that are invaded and occupied
by the enemy?”</p>

<p>The noble lord’s answer showed me,
more than anything I have said up till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
now, what were the thoughts which exclusively
obsessed him.</p>

<p>Lord Granville was not embarrassed by
my question. He thought one could simply
get the votes of the yet unoccupied provinces,
and that that would be enough to
obtain a “Representation of the Nation.”
I began to have less and less understanding
of the Minister’s arguments, and carried
away by feelings which I had difficulty in
controlling, I answered with spirit: “No,
M. le Comte, France will never hold Elections
in such a manner.”</p>

<p>Did Lord Granville feel the bitterness
of his proposal, or did he understand the
uselessness of insisting on it? Whichever
it may be, he answered me in roughly
these words: “I understand. But let me
see if I cannot convince you. As you do
not want to have Elections without an
armistice, and as the Conseils Généraux
cannot serve for the composition of a Constitutional
Assembly&mdash;you have explained the
reasons and I quite understand them&mdash;then
why have you not accepted an armistice?
You say that you think twelve days might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
at a pinch be enough for the Elections.
Then why do you not ask for a twelve
days’ armistice?” Without waiting for
my answer he went on to say: “Think
well and look the facts in the face. Prussia
could push her troops even further into
France. She could occupy the whole
country and would always be in the
situation which is troubling us, that of
not knowing with whom to treat for
peace.” I think that at this point Lord
Granville touched as it were on the possibility
of restoring the Empire. To be more
exact, he allowed me glimpses of a theory,
timidly and in terms that were so vague
that they have escaped my memory, that
Prussia might very well come to the idea,
failing a better one, of treating with the
last Government which France had had.</p>

<p>And without waiting for my reply he
continued: “France has given an exhibition
of military courage which has aroused
the admiration of the world, but there is
also a <i>civil courage</i> which a great people
must not neglect, and which is even greater
and more admirable than military courage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
You have done great things, but you must
now have the civil courage which consists
in recognising your true situation and in
ceasing to sacrifice the precious blood of
your children when such a sacrifice can
no longer be of use.”</p>

<p>“M. le Comte,” said I, “I thank you
sincerely for the expressions of admiration
you have just uttered. Coming from you
they have great value, but I believe that
though you admire our military courage
you take too black a view of the situation.
We have not reached that point yet.</p>

<p>“Paris, wonderful Paris, the heart and
the hope of France, has held out. She
is on her feet and inflamed with the desire
to defend herself, and she will defend herself
for a long time yet. The great city
is not yet ready for surrender, and the
provinces are only beginning to awaken.
In but a little while they will bring against
Prussia, who is accustomed to the idea that
there are no more soldiers in France, a
young but enthusiastic army, and it will
not be the first time that young French
recruits have beaten the seasoned armies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
of Prussia. There is the truth. Military
courage, therefore, is not yet useless. It
is not yet beaten and need not yet hand
over the fate of the country to that elder
brother whom you have well called “civil
courage.”</p>

<p>Lord Granville answered: “If you think
your resistance can bring about a better
result for you, you are right in continuing
the struggle, however unequal it may be.
But if this only serves to weaken the
country even more, the men who have
the fate of the nation in their hands are
<i>in duty bound</i> to stop and not to ask
for useless sacrifices from this courageous
people. The resources of France are immense;
we know it well. She will very
quickly lift herself up from these temporary
disasters.”...</p>

<p>M. de Beust, it will be remembered, had
already expressed the same idea....</p>

<p>“Yes,” continued Lord Granville, “she
will recover very quickly. Her elasticity
is wonderful, but one must not put it to
too severe a test. One must not break the
springs.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
I found pleasure in hearing him speak
in this manner, and I began to like his
slow and well-weighed words, which so
far had not given me much encouragement.
Lord Granville had shown a certain
warmth in admiring the resources
and the “wonderful elasticity” of France.
He finished by laying weight on his words:
“Your Government’s responsibility in continuing
the conflict is great, for the nation
itself has not yet pronounced on the serious
question: Does it want war to continue
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">ad infinitum</i>?</p>

<p>“Your Government is full of confidence
in the vitality of the country and refuses
to surrender to Prussian demands, but you
do not know what are the feelings of the
nation. And if the nation is not of your
way of thinking, or if your Government
is mistaken, if instead of pushing back the
enemy you were to see him advance still
further? His demands would only be
increased and you would have imposed
sacrifices on your country that are as
fruitless as they are painful.”</p>

<p>It was difficult not to admit the justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
of this reasoning, and I did not hesitate
to tell him so. But I again and insistently
asked him to reflect and to admit
that it was impossible to go to the country
to sound its feelings while the enemy refused
us the physical means of doing so. I
assured him that the Government would
have been happy to be able to consult the
country, and that even now there was no
greater nor more pressing desire; but how
was it to be effected?</p>

<p>“Can one make Electors come together
with rifles on their shoulders in order to
vote, while the Prussians are advancing
to occupy our towns? Is it not evident
that to have Elections we must have an
armistice?</p>

<p>“Just now,” I said, “I think I gathered
that if you had a counsel to give us it
would be to try and have the Elections in
the shortest possible time, and to ask for
a shorter armistice than in the previous
negotiations, which fell through over the
question of re-victualling. Would you in
such a case offer your good services, and
would you charge yourself with reopening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
the negotiations on this matter?” He
answered: “I have already told M. Thiers
that the best form of negotiation would
be for you to address the General Staff
at Versailles direct and without intermediary.”</p>

<p>I pointed out to Lord Granville that he
himself knew the situation sufficiently well
to foresee that the result of direct negotiations
with the General Staff at Versailles
could only be negative. “Besides,” I said,
“the question which I have taken the
liberty of putting to you had its sole
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">raison d’être</i> in our conversation. The
question was born of the moment and is
part of a purely personal reflection. It was
only suggested to me by my desire to show
you how much I have at heart the understanding
of the remarks which I have the
honour of hearing from your lips.”</p>

<p>After Lord Granville’s advice to address
ourselves direct to the General Staff at
Versailles, it was clear to me that the only
wish of the English Government was not
to expose itself, to keep strictly and
prudently out of the way and to interfere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
in the negotiations as little as possible&mdash;that
is to say, to have nothing to do with
them. For all this there was a peremptory
reason. It was not entirely lack of goodwill,
but the fear of compromising themselves.</p>

<p>Everywhere I observed this exaggerated
fear of being dragged into a conflict with
Prussia. At that time I regarded this feeling
as one of weakness, but on reflection
it seems to me that it must be judged
less severely. One cannot arm from one
day to another. Moreover, a great Power
cannot raise its voice without giving its
words the support of arms should it not
be listened to. And Prussia, as I have
already said, would have listened to
nothing, unless it were a general at the
head of a strong army. Now England
at that time had no army either. She was
in a complete state of peace. Besides, had
she not been warned by her rebuff from the
Prussian General Staff that she had only
one thing to do: <i>keep quiet!</i></p>

<p>In fact if Lord Granville thus sent me
back to Versailles to re-open negotiations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
for an armistice it was because “Odo”&mdash;that
is the Christian name by which he
called the Under-Secretary of State, Mr.
Odo Russell, who was with the General
Staff&mdash;had written him that M. de Bismarck
would no longer listen to him. “M. Odo,”
said he, “wrote to me only yesterday that
France had now better approach the
General Staff direct and that M. de
Bismarck has nothing further to say
to me.”</p>

<p>It was an irrefutable argument, and the
least I could do to repay such frankness
was not to insist any more, unless it were
openly to ask the Secretary of State that
England should go to war.</p>

<p>But yet I did not wish to retire. Seeing
that Lord Granville still listened to me with
interest and appeared in no hurry to terminate
our interview, I moved the armchair,
on which I was seated and which
I had pushed back a little during the last
part of our conversation, a little nearer to
him. His knees nearly touched mine. I
looked at him, trying to read into his blue
eyes, and I <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
“You have received me so kindly that I
would like to speak as frankly as you will
allow me. I am young, M. le Comte, and
I am still younger in diplomacy....”</p>

<p>“And I am old in diplomacy,” he
answered, laughing and showing a line of
very white teeth which seemed formally
to belie his words.</p>

<p>“You must therefore be indulgent to me
and my inexperience....”</p>

<p>“I have not noticed it,” said he, laughing
again, in order to encourage me.</p>

<p>“And if you find that I am perhaps too
persistent you will lay the blame on my
inexperience and the youthfulness of my
heart. I cannot remain calm and master
my emotion, when I think of Europe to-day
and of the actual situation in France. It
is a situation that you know well.</p>

<p>“Now you have given us advice, a good
and excellent piece of advice, and the advice
of a friend. You have told us: Hold your
Elections. I have pointed out the impossibility
of doing so without an armistice....
And you send me back to the General
Staff at Versailles to get it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
“I assure you, M. le Comte, <i>that</i> means
war, the continuation of war to the point
of exhaustion. France will not yield; she
will continue to defend herself to the last
man; she will let her territory be invaded
down to the last village rather than accept
unacceptable conditions.</p>

<p>“Will Europe continue as an impassive
spectator of this terrible conflict?</p>

<p>“Will England continue to fold her arms
without intervening to stop the carnage
between two peoples?”</p>

<p>“We can do nothing to stop it,” he
objected.</p>

<p>“But,” I said, “what a great and
wonderful part you could play! You
would stop a barbarous war of destruction
between two civilised peoples, give
back to Europe the peace she so ardently
desires, and of which she has as much
need as France herself after these terrible
conflicts, after the entire upsetting of all
political, economic and financial relationships.
You would thus create for yourselves
a striking claim to the gratitude not
only of France, your ancient friend and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
ally, but also of the whole of Europe.
With your great experience you can yourself
clearly see that if we remain alone to
deal with our enemy, his demands will be
such that peace cannot be concluded in a
lasting fashion.</p>

<p>“Therefore your intervention would be a
service to all Europe.</p>

<p>“And all this would cost you no great
sacrifice. There would be no need for you
to go to war against Germany. It would
be enough for you to take up a firm and
resolute attitude such as reason, humanity
and forethought for the future all dictate
to you.”</p>

<p>“And if they do not listen to us? We
cannot make war on Prussia! We have
done all we could; we have made many
representations at Versailles, but they will
no longer listen to us.”</p>

<p>“Because you have not dared to speak
as one must speak in order to be listened
to. Because you have not dared or wished
to speak the strong words which alone
carry weight with Prussia and because
you have confined yourselves to timid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
observations and discreet counsels, hesitatingly
offered ... and which you scarcely
dared to offer.</p>

<p>“Prussia will certainly not yield to these!
But if you were to change your tone, you
would very quickly see Prussia change her
attitude.”</p>

<p>“But what attitude do you want us to
take up, and what do you mean by
“<i>strong</i>” words?”</p>

<p>“I will tell you, M. le Comte; say this
to <span class="locked">Prussia:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“You have attained unprecedented successes
and you have completely and
entirely gained all your desires. A new
conflict will add nothing to the advantages
you have gained. Therefore stop
now, for the war is now beginning to
become a war of racial destruction. Stop,
and give the French Government a chance
of consulting with the people, and then
conclude peace with it. Do not refuse
Europe the peace which she has need of.”</p>

<p>&mdash;“But if Prussia pays no attention to
these words?”</p>

<p>&mdash;“You must support your words by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
arms, I admit. But that will not be war,
because you do not want to make war.
No, it will not be war, because Prussia
does not want it any more than you do.
But Prussia will yield before the possibility
of seeing England entering the fight at a
time when she has need of all her strength
to finish off with France alone.”</p>

<p>“How should you know that?” he
answered. “What guarantee can you give
me? Allow me to tell you,” and he smiled
very graciously in order to sweeten his
words, “you are not in the counsels of the
King at Versailles and you cannot know
anything about it any more than I can.”</p>

<p>“I do not know, it is true; but may
one not make calculations?</p>

<p>“You know even better than I how immensely
the whole of Germany desires to
see the war ended. Prussia thinks that
with France alone she will soon reach her
goal. Will she be willing to prolong the
war and in a sense renew it with a great
Power like England? And I am entitled
to tell you that England would not be
alone with France in such a war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
“I have just come from Vienna. I was
told at Vienna, and authorised to repeat
it to you, that Austria is disposed to go
hand-in-hand with England in everything
that concerns France. Austria would
follow England if the latter would decide
to intervene effectively in favour of
France.”</p>

<p>“... Who told you that?” Lord
Granville quickly interrupted me. “Was
it M. de Beust?”</p>

<p>As I saw that Lord Granville was in no
way inclined to do what I asked him, it
did not seem necessary to answer him
and perhaps to compromise a sincere and
devoted friend by publishing the secret of
his friendly disposition towards ourselves.
So I answered this question by saying that,
if Lord Granville would be kind enough
to wait a moment, I would later on tell
him who was the person in question. The
promise, however, had been made me in
Vienna, it had been made in full view of
its provoking action on the part of England,
and I had been expressly authorised to
speak of it here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
“But that would be war&mdash;and we do not
want war!” he answered energetically.</p>

<p>“No, it will not be war. On the contrary,
it will be the end of war,” I said with
spirit. “It is certainly very bold of me to
want to foresee events better than you and
contradict a view which appears to you
sound. But I say it with conviction, it will
not be war. No, it will be peace, and a peace
worthy of two nations, a durable peace.</p>

<p>“And this is the reason why. In the
face of European intervention, brought
about by the initiative of England, Prussia
would be obliged to diminish her exorbitant
pretensions, and France would, on her side,
be reasonable and listen to the counsels of
Europe.</p>

<p>“You know from his action at Ferrières
what M. Jules Favre’s policy is.</p>

<p>“That policy has not been changed.</p>

<p>“We are decided to continue the fight
to the last limits of human strength, as
against demands which we cannot accept.
But we are ready, France is ready, to
accept any conditions which are not incompatible
with her honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
“Effective intervention on the part of
England would therefore mean peace, and
a durable peace, because it would be consented
to without humiliation for the conquered
side, for valiant France who will
always, in spite of her actual defects,
remain a great and chivalrous nation.”</p>

<p>My persistence did not appear to satisfy
Lord Granville. He followed me willingly
on every question and infused much spirit
and cordiality into the conversation, but
every time I came back to the noble rôle
that England might play by using her
authority and power for effective intervention,
he seemed painfully impressed
and impatient to terminate the discussion.
Perhaps he himself felt, without
caring to confess it, that I was right
when I showed him the splendid part his
country might play in the sanguinary
drama that was being enacted in France,
and perhaps his were the painful feelings
of a man who is obliged to fight against
his own convictions. In any case, the
subject seemed to importune him and try
his patience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
On this occasion he answered me that
France must not forget that it was definitely
she who had commenced the war.
Our conversation turned at length round
this point, the declaration of war by the
Empire, the military consequences of the
Empire’s fall and the change in the very
nature of the war. But these questions
are no longer of interest to-day, and I
pass them by. Our conversation had
already lasted more than an hour, and
I was getting ready to say good-bye to Lord
Granville.</p>

<p>“If I have understood you aright,” I
said, “you will do absolutely nothing
for us?”</p>

<p>“Personally I should like to do all that
is in my power. For you see,” he added,
with a sincere and almost paternal air, “I
am fond of France and the French, and
I would be happy to contribute to your
success. But as a statesman I must tell
you that we cannot make war for France.
War, you see, is a terrible thing, and one
must think well before going to war. You
are a more warlike people than we are; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
French fight for an idea, and that would be
impossible for us. When we closed the last
Session of Parliament, we undertook not
to deviate from the strictest neutrality, and
we were applauded by Parliament. We
cannot go before Parliament now and
proclaim war. We have not the right
and we cannot do it.”</p>

<p>“But, if I am well informed,” I objected,
“a war with Prussia would not actually
meet with much opposition from public
opinion. It seems to me that such a war
would, on the contrary, be popular in
England.” I also said that the situation
had altered considerably since the English
Cabinet had given its parting message to
Parliament.</p>

<p>“France is to-day fighting for a just
cause. She is defending hearth and home
and the integrity of her soil. She has given
proof of extraordinary strength and vigour
in this unequal and terrible combat and she
has regained that which she had lost by the
declaration of war&mdash;I mean the sympathies
of the entire world. That is why public
opinion has changed also in England, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
that is why I believe that effective intervention
would in England to-day be a
popular action.” Lord Granville answered
me: “Let me explain the true situation of
our country in this matter. The military,
particularly the officers, are in favour of
France. They want war. Then there is a
numerous enough party among the working-class
population who share this sentiment.
But all the rest of the population have
ideas which differ according to the political
opinions which they profess. We have
Republicans, Imperialists, Orleanists, Legitimists,
etc. You see we have seriously
considered the question,” he went on to
say, “we don’t want to speak without
being able to give our words the support
that is necessary to make them heard. If
Prussia did not listen to us, we could not
let it remain at that, and we are quite
decided to keep the undertaking we have
made to Parliament. That is why we
cannot do more than we have done up till
now.”</p>

<p>“Which means,” I said, “that you can
do nothing?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
“Not so,” he answered. “But <i>for the
moment</i> we can do nothing. Later on,
when peace conditions are discussed, we
will be able to intervene in the negotiations
more successfully.”</p>

<p>“Later on!” I exclaimed. “Do you
know what will happen later on, M. le
Comte. Later on one of two things will
happen; either we shall be victorious and
we will push the Prussians back; that is
what I hope, and then we will have need
of no one; or we shall be conquered,
and then you will dare to speak even less
than now; at any rate, Prussia will then
pay no more attention to your words than
she does now. If you do not want to be
condemned never to act, you must act
now.”</p>

<p>Lord Granville answered: “I don’t want
you to leave me under the slightest illusion
on this matter. I have already said so
to M. Thiers&mdash;we cannot deviate from the
strict neutrality which we have observed
till to-day.” He added that Prussia had
long been complaining about England’s
interpretation of neutrality in delivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
arms to France and so prolonging her
resistance. But he, Lord Granville, had
answered that such had been England’s
conduct since the beginning of the war,
that her conduct was perfectly compatible
with strict neutrality, and that she was not
going to change it now, etc.</p>

<p>I answered: “Your reply, M. le Comte,
is distinct and categorical, and I thank you
for it. Only let me present one last consideration.
It concerns the Eastern question.
Have you nothing to fear on that
side? Do you not think that France’s
word will one day be useful and her help
precious?</p>

<p>“You do not want to make war now,
but perhaps you may be forced to make
it later, and then you will be isolated
and alone because you have abandoned
France, your old friend and natural ally,
in the hour of danger. Think of the
future, M. le Comte! France has a
future; she will recover from this war
and she will be stronger, greater, and more
powerful, because she has given proof
of her wonderful vitality and energy in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
adversity. Our fleet will then be able to
play a great rôle. If you abandon us now
you may be alone in your turn when you
are forced to take up arms and have need
of an ally.”</p>

<p>“When we are forced to it,” said he,
“well, we will take up arms and we will
go to war....” But he said that England
was not for the moment in this situation
and consequently he did not see the necessity
for changing her policy. His Government
would never take the formidable decision
of dragging the country into war
without being absolutely obliged to do so.</p>

<p>He once more recalled the terms with
which the last Session of Parliament had
closed, and the terrible responsibility for
a Government to precipitate a nation into
the sufferings and miseries of war. Then,
after some protestations of friendship towards
France, he finished with these
<span class="locked">words:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“I do not want to leave the slightest
misapprehension in your mind, and would
like to continue elaborating my ideas.”
He then definitely laid down as it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
into an unchangeable proposition, the
reasons which he had indicated why it
was impossible to change anything in the
policy that England had observed up till
now.</p>

<p>Our Interview was at an end. Only I
did not want to leave Lord Granville
without saying a word on the impossibility
of restoring the Empire.</p>

<p>He had done no more than hint at the
idea that the Empire might possibly be
restored to France by the enemy, and his
allusions were so slight and, I might almost
say, so intangible, that when an hour afterwards
I returned to my lodging and made
notes of the principal passages in our conversation,
I found it impossible exactly to
remember the terms he had employed in
speaking of it.</p>

<p>However, he often came back to this
point. Even when he insisted that the
National Defence Government would do
well to call a National Assembly under
any conditions whatsoever, even without
an armistice, one of his arguments consisted
in pointing out the possibility of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
Imperial Restoration. “At the worst,” he
insinuated, “Prussia might well negotiate
with what remains of the Empire.”</p>

<p>I therefore thought it would be useful
not to let this idea take root in his mind,
and to make him understand that it was
a pure delusion, which it would even be
dangerous to entertain. I told him that
I did not know up to what point competent
men in England were capable of seriously
regarding such an event as being possible
in France, but if they believed in it for a
single moment they would be strangely
deceived. The restoration of the Empire
was henceforward absolutely impossible.
The supporters of the fallen régime had
absolutely no illusions on this point.</p>

<p>“They themselves are perfectly aware,”
I continued, “at least, those who have remained
in France, that the country is no
longer with them, and that the prisoner
of Wilhelmshohe will never remount the
throne of France, neither he nor those that
are his. Sedan has for ever demolished
the Napoleonic Idea, and the bloodstained
and terrible ending of the Second Empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
has for ever cured the nation of all
dangerous legends. To-day we know too
well what it costs a great country to give
itself a master whose only merit is an illustrious
name, and there is no temptation to
again give way to that sort of madness!
He who is to-day the enemy’s willing
prisoner has fallen too low for a proud
nation like France ever to forget the disgrace.
Has the unhappy Emperor even
to-day no fear of accusing, against all
sense of justice, the brave country which
was formerly his Empire, of having wanted
and provoked the war? His return to
France would be the signal for a general
rising, and if Prussia wanted to attempt it
she would be obliged to protect him with
her armies and so perpetuate the war
instead of definitely terminating it.”</p>

<p>Our conversation had lasted more than
an hour and a half, and it was at Lord
Granville’s own wish that it had done so,
for he had been interrupted several times.
On each occasion I rose to retire, but he
had held me back every time, graciously
and with the serious insistence of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
who does not wish to interrupt a subject
which he does not yet consider exhausted.
When at last I took my leave of him, he
wrung my hand cordially and said he
would be happy to obtain me a safe conduct
which would allow me to go back
to Paris, and that he would ask for it
to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>In our conversation, as has been seen,
I did not conceal my desire to find a
means of returning to Paris. I would thus
be able to describe to the National Defence
Government the general situation in Europe,
and the attitude of the Cabinets and the
sentiments of the Courts of Vienna and
London.</p>

<p>Lord Granville heard my wishes very
affably, and was at great pains to help
them. So I did not hesitate to profit
from his disposition, and begged him to
ask for a safe conduct for me.</p>

<p>Unfortunately my desire and his were
not realised. Next day Lord Granville
informed me that the démarche had not
succeeded and that he had been refused the
safe conduct which he had asked for me.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap i"><span class="smcap1">I</span> have been scrupulously exact in reporting
nearly all the essential parts
of my conversation with Lord Granville.</p>

<p>I should like to do as much for the
long interview which I had later with Mr.
Gladstone, at that time Prime Minister in
the English Cabinet. The words of this
eminent statesman are all of them imbued
with a special character, which renders
them in the highest degree interesting, even
when they ran counter to my wishes.
However, “est modus in rebus” and one
must know when to stop in a short narrative
and be careful above all not to repeat
oneself.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone clearly had the same
ideas as Lord Granville regarding the
war and regarding England’s neutrality
and the possibility of her taking any steps
in the interests of France. In substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
he told me exactly the same as Lord Granville
had done on all these questions.</p>

<p>It will appear later that the two Ministers
must have conferred together and taken
concerted views before receiving me, so as
to express exactly the same opinions. So
I will do no more than give an extract of
my conversation with Mr. Gladstone and
record in summary the principal questions
which arose.</p>

<p>I first met Mr. Gladstone at the house
of his colleague, Lord Granville.</p>

<p>The latter gave a dinner in my honour the
day after my first interview with him, and
among other persons he had also invited Mr.
Gladstone. That is how I made this gentleman’s
acquaintance, and I looked forward
to profiting by it in furtherance of the enterprise
which had brought me to London.</p>

<p>It was certainly impossible for me to
hope, after the formal declaration of Lord
Granville, that his colleague the Prime
Minister would have different views and
would be more disposed than the former to
depart from the contemplative policy which
seemed so dear to England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
At the same time I was convinced that it
was not necessary for England to plunge
into war, which she would not do at any
price, in order effectively to serve France’s
interests. If only she had consented to
take up another attitude, her intervention
would have certainly sufficed without it
being necessary to go to the point of armed
intervention in order to modify Prussian
demands at the moment of negotiation.</p>

<p>I had not lost all hope of persuading
English statesmen of this truth, and I was
very desirous of seeing the Prime Minister
to sound his thoughts, and in my turn
express our views and aspirations.</p>

<p>The day after meeting him at Lord Granville’s
I wrote to him asking for an interview.
He had already gone off to spend
Christmas at Hawarden Castle, a splendid
country seat in the extreme west of the
island, in the county of Lancashire, near
the city of Chester. London society always
passes a good part of the winter at its
country seats. That is easily understood,
as the winter is sad and sombre by the
foggy banks of the Thames, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
English countryside is charming even in
winter.</p>

<p>What astonished me more was that the
Prime Minister of a great country like
England could find it possible to live for
a part of the year at such a distance from
the capital, Hawarden Castle being situated
at the other end of Great Britain. One
has to cross the entire length of the country
between London and Liverpool to get there,
and if my memory serves me aright, I think
the express train from London takes six
hours to reach the little station, which is
two miles from the Castle. What would
they say in France of a “President du
Conseil” who wanted to live so far from
Paris? The thing would be thought impossible
and so in truth it would be. But in
London, on the contrary, everybody finds
it natural and things are not carried on
any the worse for it. But the English are
a practical people, and we are not.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone has simply got the telegraph
as his auxiliary; it is installed at
the Castle and goes direct from his study
to his Ministerial Office in London. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
can thus be in permanent communication
with the whole Department and can transmit
his orders at any hour of the day or
night.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone immediately answered my
letter. He wrote that he much regretted
having left for the country before having
had an opportunity of receiving me, but
that he flattered himself by hoping that I
would not shrink from a journey in order
to give him the pleasure of a visit and that
I would accept his hospitality at Hawarden
Castle. He did not intend returning to
London for some time and we should be
quite at our ease at the Castle and could
talk together about any matter I liked.</p>

<p>I did not hesitate to accept his invitation,
but knowing that in England Christmas is
par excellence a family gathering, I did
not want to come in as a stranger, and
I answered that I would make a point of
visiting him two days after Christmas. Mr.
Gladstone’s son met me at the station on
my arrival, and my room was ready at the
Castle.</p>

<p>The next day, after breakfast, the master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
of the house put himself at my disposition
for an interview, and we repaired to his
study.</p>

<p>The interview was a long and cordial one,
and again confirmed my conviction that
the reason why we had been so completely
abandoned by our neighbours was that the
war had broken out so suddenly that no
one had expected it and no Power had had
the time to be prepared.</p>

<p>At the risk of being accused of needless
repetition, I must again describe what
had already struck me in my interviews
in Vienna, in London and everywhere&mdash;that
is, that the Powers were afraid of
our conquerors. Nor was this fear without
foundation; it arose from the state
of impotence into which the suddenness
of the war had plunged every Government.
The war had surprised them
while in absolute repose, and, as it were,
asleep.</p>

<p>In all Europe a single Power was on
guard and not taken by surprise, for she
was waiting for the alarm signal and had
long been prepared for it. It was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
enemy which the Empire had chosen in a
moment of evil fortune and blindness.</p>

<p>When I say that only a <i>single</i> Power foresaw
the signal and was prepared, that is
true in the literally numerical sense of the
word; not even with the exception of the
unhappy Empire which had caused such
general stupefaction by provoking the war.</p>

<p>To-day it is proved that the Empire went
to war with Prussia as if it had been a
military promenade to Berlin. It did not
see any danger, and not even any difficulties
... and such was its blindness
that it entered on this ill-omened war
without even having prepared the material
means necessary for such a struggle, and
without having assured itself of any allies.
We were completely isolated, and this
isolation was forcibly and by the fatality
of things doomed to last till the end, till
the conclusion of peace.</p>

<p>When the candidature of the Prince
of Hohenzollern was definitely abandoned,
and when it appeared for a moment that
the threatening storm had cleared, the
Powers all immediately recovered from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
their alarm and thought the incident
finished. The declaration of war which
afterwards supervened at a time when it
was no longer expected by anyone, forcibly
threw all the States in Europe into profound
stupefaction, and found them in a
state of absolute impotence. They were
denied the material possibility of arming,
and the rapidity of events had robbed them
of the time necessary for their preparations.</p>

<p>Then, hostilities once commenced, Prussia
did not allow them to take breath or to
recover from their stupefaction. On the
contrary, their amazement grew day by
day, with the swift and bewildering rush
of her victories. Therefore our isolation,
which marked the beginning of the war
and which gave the character of criminal
folly to the enterprise, continued during
our disasters up till the last moment of
the terrible negotiations which finished
with the mutilation of France.</p>

<p>The selfishness and the inertia of the
Powers certainly equalled the madness of
those responsible for such a declaration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
war. If the rulers who presided over their
destinies had then decided to follow a more
elevated and far-seeing policy, the mutilation
of France would have been prevented.
The germs of new complications in the
more or less distant future would have been
removed, and the foundations of a sincere
and lasting peace would have been laid in
Europe. The era of general disarmament,
the Golden Age of modern times, could
have been prepared. But alas, the opportunity
was lost!</p>

<p>The Powers, however, were able to explain
their conduct in words often repeated
to me at the time: “You have taken us by
surprise and we are not ready. France is
invaded, the German armies are victorious
and intoxicated by success. If Prussia
were to refuse our intervention and take
us as at our word, the day we spoke more
boldly we should with you be beaten,
because we are neither armed nor in
a condition to fight against victorious
Germany.”</p>

<p>This is the explanation of the pusillanimous
attitude which the States of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
maintained during the war and which no
Power dared to depart from, even at the
moment of concluding peace.</p>

<p>France lacked neither sympathy nor
good wishes, but our enemy was feared,
and none felt themselves in a position to
challenge him. This, if I am not in error,
was the real cause of our isolation, even
at the end of the conflict when sympathy
for us had revived and France had shown
courage and vigour worthy of another fate.</p>

<p>But to return to my interview with Mr.
Gladstone at Hawarden Castle. If it was
as sterile as all the others, it was at least
complete. We examined every question
exhaustively and in the minutest details.</p>

<p>Mr. Glynn, the member of Parliament
and Secretary to the Treasury, who was
a friend of the family, on seeing me leave
the study with Mr. Gladstone, said: “You
may flatter yourself on having enjoyed
more of the Prime Minister’s society than
anyone else I know. Since Mr. Gladstone
has become Premier he has never granted
anyone as long an interview as he has to
you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
This was evidently very flattering to the
cause which had brought me here. Indeed,
it was worth anyone’s while thoroughly
to discuss it, but without in the slightest
degree overlooking the great kindness of
my charming host, I would have preferred
a more satisfactory result even if it had
meant a shorter interview.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone spoke French perfectly,
but he asked my permission&mdash;this is a
characteristic trait which shows the practical
and cautious mind of the great statesman
of the Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;to carry on
the conversation in English because, as
he said, he was more certain of the
accuracy of his expressions in his own
language.</p>

<p>“The accuracy of his expressions!”&mdash;&mdash;Does
that not teach one a remarkable
lesson?</p>

<p>Here is an eminent Minister who has
grown old in politics and is accustomed
to the most important and difficult conversations.
He finds himself in the presence
of one who is young enough to be
his son, and he takes serious precautions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
to guarantee the sureness of his speech and
the accuracy of his expressions!</p>

<p>I learnt the lesson and followed his example.
I accepted his proposal and asked
for reciprocity&mdash;that is to say, for permission
for me to answer in French. Our
conversation was therefore carried on in
two languages, Mr. Gladstone speaking
English and I replying in French.</p>

<p>The first point we discussed was the
election of a National Assembly.</p>

<p>On this matter Mr. Gladstone gave utterance
to an opinion which well marks the
difference between him and Lord Granville.
I have faithfully set down Lord Granville’s
views, and the reader has seen how insistently
he advised the election, in any
manner whatsoever, of a National Assembly.
Now here is what Mr. Gladstone thought
on this <span class="locked">matter:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Should one proceed to elections, said
he, or should one not even think of
such a thing under existing circumstances?
That is purely and essentially a domestic
question, which concerns no one outside
the French Government. The French<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
Government is the only judge, and a
sovereign judge, of that question; and no
foreign nation has the right to be heard
on the desirability of this measure. But
Mr. Gladstone, like Lord Granville, could
not see the impossibility of holding Elections
without an armistice, and said that,
if he were entitled to offer his advice to
the French Government, he would counsel
them to do so. But he did not refuse
to recognise that there were very good
grounds for a contrary opinion.</p>

<p>If one cannot go so far as to declare,
said he, that it is materially impossible to
call a National Assembly, at least there
is what may be called a moral impossibility.
Because the dignity of the elections
would suffer very much from the presence
of the enemy and the actual condition of
the country.</p>

<p>Personally he had no hesitation in recognising
the National Defence Government
as for the time being the legal government
of the country. This Government was
strong with the approval and the assent
not only of Paris, which had confirmed it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
by a formal vote, but of the whole of
France, and every day that passed served
to augment its moral force and authority
within and without the country. He recognised
with pleasure the efforts that
had been made by the National Defence
Government to hold its own against the
enemy, and he congratulated it on the
great progress in resistance which, thanks
to its efforts, had been made.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone was not chary of compliments
to ourselves, and seemed animated
by great admiration for France and by a
deep desire to see our efforts crowned by
success. Recent events in particular had
given him hopes that we should arrive at
the desired result by our own strength.</p>

<p>When we were speaking of the military
deeds of the last fortnight&mdash;the battles of
the army of the Loire and the general
organisation of the country&mdash;he himself contrasted
the position at the beginning of
the war with the progress that we had
since made.</p>

<p>“I have observed with pleasure,” said he,
“that there is a great change in your situation;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
your military organisation has made
considerable advance. As you rightly say,
the war has entered a new phase. You
have no longer only defeats, you have also
successes to record and, above all, your
resistance is a serious one. You have
soldiers, you have army corps to put in
the field against the enemy. Prussia is
beginning to encounter serious obstacles
in her path. All this is really admirable
and gives one reason to hope that you will
perhaps soon enter a last phase, that of
success. But one must not hide from oneself
that it is only a distant hope. You
are still only <i>in the state of solid resistance</i>.</p>

<p>“I have great confidence in your final
success. The <i>fundamental power of the
French Nation is greater than is usually
thought</i>. This fundamental power appears
throughout her history. Take, for instance,
the reign of Louis the Fourteenth. See
what France suffered in the wars of that
period and see what she became in spite
of her exhaustion. And one must not
forget that France was at that time divided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
into small States, while she is now a single
and great united country.”</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone continued on these lines,
and he did not tire of admiring the prodigious
efforts which we had made and
which we were daily making to resist an
enemy who had every advantage over us.
But when I thanked him for his words
and asked him for more effective and less
Platonic assistance than pure admiration,
he answered me as his colleague Lord
Granville had done, by an absolute “non
possumus.” England wished for France’s
success, but she could not leave the strict
neutrality she had maintained from the
beginning of the struggle. The Government
could not unnecessarily throw the country
into such an adventure and expose it to
a formidable war.</p>

<p>And the English statesman expounded
his system with great warmth and remarkable
eloquence.</p>

<p>Parliament had closed its last Session
with a formal declaration on the part of
the Cabinet, which might be resumed in
the single word: “Peace.” The Government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
had solemnly promised to an approving
country that it would assure it the
precious boon of peace, and it had no
right to take away all the advantages and
all the blessings which peace sheds on a
rich, strong and industrious nation. The
Government were bound by their promise
and they would be guilty of a crime if they
wished to break it.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone is a philosopher and a
historian. He likes to go back to principles
and to look at questions from the
lofty point of view of morality. After
pointing out that his Government had
given the country an undertaking that it
would maintain peace, he discussed the
question of war in general.</p>

<p>“War is a terrible disaster for humanity.
Are there any circumstances which may
justify a Government throwing a country
into war, and what are such circumstances?”</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone desired to narrow the limits
within which war might be considered justifiable
as much as possible, but he thought
that a great country had the right to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
war whenever the <i>cause</i> was a <i>just</i> one.
Consequently he considered that a Government
may engage the country in a just
war, but only on condition that the nation
has given its consent.</p>

<p>I accepted this principle; the proposition
seemed to be a good one for my case, and
I let him continue without interruption.
After his exposition I brought the conversation
back to the actual state of affairs
by observing to Mr. Gladstone that the war
between France and Germany had greatly
changed in character since the overthrow
of the Empire.</p>

<p>At the beginning, it might have been held
from a philosophic point of view that the
war was an unjust one as far as we were
concerned, and that it had been provoked
without sufficient reason for the purpose
of conquest. But now the Empire had
disappeared and France alone was face to
face with Germany. <i>Reparation was being
offered for the damage which her Government
had done in provoking the war.</i> The
French nation, which had never wanted the
war, was now fighting for its existence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
the integrity of its soil. France was now
defending herself against invasion and <i>conquest</i>.
She was therefore continuing the
fight for a just and strong cause, and it
was Germany that was refusing to end a
war which had become an immoral and
an impious one as far as the latter was
concerned, since her haughtily avowed and
only end was the brutal conquest of Alsace
and Lorraine.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone did not deny the justice
of this argument.</p>

<p>I went on, and asked him if he did not
admit that a great nation might not only
have the right but even, up to a certain
point, the duty, of intervening in a war of
this nature. Did not the necessity for intervention
exist, if intervention not only
served to maintain a just and moral cause,
but were also to a nation’s own interest?</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone again admitted that there
might possibly be circumstances which
would oblige England to take up arms
and intervene in a struggle between two
other Powers, but he held that there were
no such circumstances in the present war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
I then told him that the future&mdash;perhaps
the very near future&mdash;would give him
cause to regret not having seized the
opportunity of putting us under an obligation
by going to war for a “moral
cause,” and with the approval of the
English people. I referred to the difficulties
preparing for England in the East
and the services we in our turn could
render her in that direction. He answered
that he did not consider the situation in
the East as dangerous, and that he did not
share the opinions of those who saw in it a
source of grave complications for England;
“I have no fears in that direction,” said
he. “At any rate it must not be forgotten
that Russia has German provinces and that
she is more threatened by Prussia than we
are. Moreover, we are sheltered from the
attacks of Prussia by the natural situation
of our country. The latter could not even
attack the little island of Heligoland against
our will.”</p>

<p>I then went on to another order of
ideas. I spoke of the ancient friendship
which united the two people and the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
economic interests which were drawing
them nearer to each other day by day. I
asked him if England from this standpoint
was not pledged to another attitude towards
France than that of being an inert and impassive
spectator at a time when her intervention
could assure for France an honourable
peace, a just and moral peace....</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone freely recognised that
France had rights to England’s friendship.
“But,” he said, “I do not think those rights
are such as to make us intervene in a war
which France has commenced herself and
without us. I do not think our friendship
can go to the point of our declaring war
against Prussia and fighting at your side.”</p>

<p>At this point Mr. Gladstone reproachfully
repeated the charge which had everlastingly
been made against us since the beginning
of the war and which I encountered everywhere
from those I addressed. “Who was
it,” said he, “who definitely commenced
this deplorable war? Who was it who
provoked it without any reason and for
the sole purpose of conquest, for the
purpose, that is, of taking the Rhine?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
My answer was a very simple one. I
looked at the question from Mr. Gladstone’s
own standpoint and loyally recognised
the wrong we had done. The war
was the work of the French Government.
The French Government alone had commenced
it without sufficient reason and
for a, from a philosophic standpoint, inexcusable
and immoral purpose&mdash;that of
conquest. I did not even try to exculpate
the nation, by saying, as I might have done,
that the French people were far from
desiring the war, and that, had they been
consulted, they would have refused it with
all their energies.</p>

<p>I admitted the nation’s responsibility
on the ground of their having supported
the Imperial Government and accepted a
régime which had the power of plunging
them into such a war and in such circumstances.
It is best to argue after his own
fashion with a Minister who likes to mix
philosophy and politics. “But do you
not perceive that the situation is to-day no
longer the same? The Government which
commenced the war no longer exists.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
To-day the people are free and have pronounced
their opinion&mdash;they have never
wanted the war. To-day they want it less
than ever. They are offering ransom to
the enemy. Do you not think that the
wrongs of the past have been made good,
as far as the nation is concerned, by the
overtures made by M. Jules Favre to M.
de Bismarck at Ferrières?”</p>

<p>I was not mistaken. Such arguments
as these were to his taste.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone freely recognised that the
interview at Ferrières might be regarded
as a considerable event. It had given
another character to the continuation of
the war, and to-day the rôles were changed.
It was Prussia who was now pressing the
purpose of conquest, and it was France
who was now defending the sacred soil of
her territory. Mr. Gladstone put much
lucidity and eloquence into the task of
expounding his views concerning wars of
conquest, legitimate defence of one’s territory,
and the “impious” continuation of
war....</p>

<p>I will not write down the entire system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
of England’s learned Prime Minister, but
will only state that he himself admitted
what I had said at the beginning&mdash;namely,
that a great nation had the right and even
the duty to intervene in an <i>impious war</i>
in order to finish it in the interests of
morality.</p>

<p>But when I asked him what was the
application of his theory to the existing
war, and when I pointed out that this was
a case in point and that his theories could
never be put into practice with more reason
than now, he shook his head....</p>

<p>“That is a tremendous responsibility,”
he answered with conviction and in a grave
and solemn voice. “To throw a nation
into war is a responsibility that makes one
shudder. The English people have suffered
cruelly from the wars of past centuries.
They need peace and they want peace. We
have not the right to throw them into all
the miseries of such a war. For it would
be a European war, a general conflagration,
and we have no right to throw
ourselves voluntarily in, without being provoked
or attacked.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
Invoking his own words against him, I
insisted on my point and did my best to
show him that his fears were exaggerated.
Far from bringing about a general conflagration,
the intervention of England
would result in preventing the continuation
of an <i>impious</i> and <i>immoral</i> war, and
intervention would have the approval of
the English people. It would be just
and moral, and almost popular in the
country.</p>

<p>Mr. Gladstone did not engage in the discussion
of the principle which he had laid
down and developed. He admitted it, but
he added; “We are not as sure as you
seem to be that war against Prussia would
be popular in England.</p>

<p>“Far be it from me to think that a great
nation can refuse to go to war when the
war is for a moral purpose. I am equally
far from denying that this war is completely
changed in character since the fall
of the Empire, inasmuch as its continuation
on the part of Prussia has conquest,
an immoral thing in itself, as its end. But
I am by no means convinced that a war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
against Prussia would be really popular
in England.</p>

<p>“Even if Austria joined us, you see it
would still be we who had commenced and
who had brought it about. Consequently it
would always be we who had caused war,
and that is a tremendous responsibility
which neither I nor any of my colleagues
would ever care to assume.”</p>

<p>As regards the surrender of Alsace and
Lorraine which Prussia demanded as a
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sine qua non</i> for conditions of peace, this
is what Mr. Gladstone thought of it.
“England will never agree to any territorial
cession. The English people have a
horror of wars of conquest and will never
give their agreement to the dismemberment
of France.”</p>

<p>I did not understand what that might
mean, as on the one side Prussia was loftily
announcing these claims, and on the other
England was definitely decided not to
oppose her. I finally understood that this
was another theory of Mr. Gladstone’s. All
he meant was that England simply did not
approve of Prussia’s annexation of the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
provinces, but that she could do nothing
to stop it.</p>

<p>From the commencement of our conversation
Mr. Gladstone had expressed
great confidence in our ultimate success.
At the end he reverted to this theme.
“Your efforts,” said he, “are prodigious
and will be crowned with success. You
will end by being victorious.” He then
reopened the question of England’s intervention
and said: “Perhaps our intervention
may be useful later.”</p>

<p>“Later,” said I. “May I ask when?”</p>

<p>“When the French armies are victorious.”</p>

<p>“What,” said I. “Is it <i>then</i> that you
intend to intervene? Is that what your
friendship consists of? You want to intervene
<i>against</i> us?”</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “<i>for</i> you. But the opportunity
will then be more favourable than
now, and Prussia will give way to us more
easily....”</p>

<p>I answered the eminent statesman as
I had already answered his excellent
colleague Lord Granville, that this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
a singular manner of practising friendship
and that at any rate his friendship would
then be useless.</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Hic Rhodos, hic salta!</i> It must be
intervention now or never!”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I will not end this summary account
without mentioning some curious phrases
uttered by Mr. Gladstone concerning the
Second Empire.</p>

<p>It was clear that we were bound to speak
of it. I had made it a rule, ever since
the inception of my journey, to speak of
it only with the greatest reserve.</p>

<p>I had foreign diplomatists to address,
and it was consequently unworthy of my
rôle and unnecessary for my mission to
belittle a Government, which France had
tolerated for eighteen years, more than it
had belittled itself.</p>

<p>But the persons I interviewed did not
consider themselves bound to the same reserve,
and the fallen Government which had
plunged France into this war was criticised
very severely both in Vienna and in London.
Among other things Mr. Gladstone <span class="locked">said:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
“We have always regarded the 2nd of
December with horror, and we have always
detested the régime it initiated. We have
a hatred of despotism. But since the
French nation accepted it, we had on our
side no other course but to tolerate it. It
was a question of domestic politics, which
in no way concerned a foreign people.</p>

<p>“Later on our dislike grew less. The
friendly relations which the Empire established
between France and England, particularly
the <i>great commercial relations</i>,
which it opened up by means of commercial
treaties, made us forget the horror
which its origin and its despotism had
inspired in us ... but with the latter
we were never frankly reconciled.</p>

<p>“It was not till the month of January,
1870, that we had hopes of amelioration.
We then thought that a new parliamentary
régime, with its attendant liberties,
was about to commence in France, and
we greeted the Ministry that was to have
given it with pleasure and satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Unfortunately, we were mistaken....”</p>

<p>Coming back to the war and the causes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
which had brought it about, Mr. Gladstone
said: “We did everything that depended
on us to prevent the fallen Government
from plunging into this war with Germany.</p>

<p>“We warned them, but they would not
listen.</p>

<p>“They absolutely wanted the war, and
they engaged in it, but not without having
been sufficiently warned, and well informed
of the condition of the enemy they were
about to provoke....”</p>

<p>The reader will remember that the same
thing had already been told me in Vienna,
and I again make no comments.</p>

<p>Nor will I comment on a very characteristic
trait of Mr. Gladstone’s, which
struck me most forcibly.</p>

<p>As he rose and left the apartment with
me, he said: “Have you from our conversation
gathered any difference between my
views and those of Lord Granville?”</p>

down the events which followed during
the months of December and January until
the conclusion of peace.</p>
